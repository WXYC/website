<h3>Description</h3>


<p>A statically generated site for WXYC. Built using the frontend framework React, NextJs as an static site generator and TinaCMS as a Git-based content management system. Styled using TailwindCSS, with help from the MUI Joy UI component library on implementing breadcrumbs. Deployed to Github Pages.</p>


<p>Supports content management for the radio station's blog and for an archive of the radio station's specialty shows and live events. Very much a work in progress!</p>

<p>[a photo of adrianne lenker bc every step of the process of developing this site was tested using the extensive collection of random photos of adrianne lenker that happen to live, easily-accessible, on my desktop]</p>


<h3>Features to add/improve</h3>
<ul>
<li>paginated/see more functionality for blog and archive pages</li>
<li>implement Next's incremental static regeneration (to try and expedite build times, as the site needs to be rebuilt whenever admin edit it b/c it's completely static and git-based)</li>
<li>
Contact form and instagram integrations (implemented in development, need to figure out how to host)
</li>
<li>Update Next and make everything TypeScript to optimize maintainability</li>
<li>Search bar for archive and blog</li>
<li>Utilize Tina blocks to make more components of site editable by admin</li>
</ul>


<h3>For anyone who wants to help</h3>
<ol>
<li>Will figure out steps and update this later!</li>
</ol>
