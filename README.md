<p>A statically generated site for WXDU, built off of a fork from our buddies over at WXYC. Built using the frontend framework React, NextJs as a static site generator and TinaCMS as a Git-based content management system. Styled using TailwindCSS, with help from the MUI Joy UI component library on implementing breadcrumbs and Headless UI on implementing dropdown menus. Deployed to Github Pages.</p>

<p>Supports content management for the radio station's blog and for an archive of the radio station's specialty shows and live events. Very much a work in progress!</p>
