Does your non-profit organization have a community-based event that you would like shared on air? We’ll be happy to assist in raising awareness of events and issues for your organization.  Keep in mind that we are a non-commercial educational radio station, so we can’t advertise, but we can definitely give information about events and issues that benefit our community.  Please email [psa@wxdu.org](http://wxdu.org/'+String.fromCharCode\(112,115,97,64,119,120,100,117,46,111,114,103\)+'?%27) with all your information.  You can also mail us information about your group/event.  Send it via snail mail to WXDU PSA Director, PO Box 90689, Durham, NC 27708.  Be sure to include dates, times, locations, event descriptions, contact information, and any other relevant material.  Please allow some time for us to get your PSA up on the air.

Email music submissions or distribution concerns to [music@wxdu.org.](mailto\:music@wxdu.org) If you would like to submit music for airplay, Bandcamp YUM codes are preferred over other types of downloads.
