### Regular Schedule![](/uploads/springDJSchedule2.png)

WXYC is a free-format radio station, which means that in an hour you'll hear a decisively non-block mix of any and all types of 20th and 21st century music. We don't separate our programs by genre — almost all shows on WXYC are a wide-ranging mix of styles and eras, although we tend to favor music that doesn't get much airplay elsewhere in the Triangle area.

We're on the air 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Each set is put together by a DJ who selects music from our library of tens of thousands of CDs and LPs.

### Specialty Programming

Most of our programming follows a non-themed freeform format. But on Sundays and select weeknights, we feature specialty programs from artist features to news shows. Learn more about our specialty shows below:
