# About

WXDU 88.7 FM is the non-commercial student-run radio station of Duke University and Durham. WXDU, as a member of the Duke University Union, exists to inform, educate, and entertain both the students of Duke University and the surrounding community of Durham through quality progressive alternative radio programming. WXDU seeks to give its staff the freedom to pursue their personal aesthetic within the framework of a cohesive format. WXDU aims to provide the listener with an alternative viewpoint untainted by commercial interests. WXDU resolves to maintain good relations with the music industry without compromising its integrity and nationally recognized commitment to quality programming. WXDU resolves to remain a laboratory where all members are free to make and learn from their mistakes.

Student radio at Duke began with WDBS (Duke Broadcasting System), which signed on the air in 1950 on AM frequency 560. In October of 1983, with the song "Station to Station" by David Bowie, WXDU 88.7FM signed on the air, and a new era of Duke radio had began. During Hurricane Fran in 1996, the WXDU Tower collapsed and we spent the next 2 years virtually off the air with a very limited signal. Through a series of benefits and through the generosity of the Duke Union, we were able to raise a new tower.

On January 2018, WXDU moved to its current location inside the Rubenstein ArtsCenter. The new station has allowed us to expand our Production Room to a full room, purchase and implement state-of-the-art equipment, and utilize the adjacent lounge for meetings and performances.

In its 75 years of operation, what is now WXDU has gone through many transmutations. In the years since we signed on to 88.7FM, the station has continued to flourish and we've maintained a local and national reputation for great music and programming.

### Structure

WXYC is an officially-recognized student organization of UNC-Chapel Hill. Our license is held by Student Educational Broadcasting Inc. (SEB), a non-profit formed in 1977 to serve as the official owner of the station. SEB was established because the FCC rejected UNC Student Government as the proposed license holder. SEB serves as the station’s board of directors and includes representatives from student government, students at large, the Chapel Hill-Carrboro community, UNC faculty and WXYC staff. The board, which meets monthly, oversees major expenses and overarching station issues. The current chair is Bill Burton, an attorney and former WXYC station manager.

The station’s day-to-day operations are managed by a station manager and business manager that are elected by SEB each April. The business manager is required to be a current UNC student; although the station manager position does not have the same requirement, the station manager is nonetheless almost always a student.

The station manager selects a group to serve as the management staff and also has the power to select the music director. Currently, the management staff consists of a team of five to eight individuals, including students and recent alumni. The management staff oversees the station’s day-to-day operations, including hiring, training, scheduling, promotions, record-keeping, fundraising and a variety of other duties.

The music department consists of the music director and a staff that they select. This group is responsible for reviewing new music and choosing which releases are placed in the playlist.

For current managers and contact information, see the [contact page](https://wxyc.org/contact).

### Funding

WXYC, one of three student organizations whose funding is guaranteed by the student government’s constitution, is funded by the Student Activity Fee paid each semester by UNC students. We supplement those funds with t-shirt sales and fundraising events such as our biannual 2000s Dance. We do not currently accept advertising or underwriting.

WXYC uses its funding to pay licensing and copyright fees, to purchase and repair equipment, to expand our music library, to cover administrative costs and for station promotions. All WXYC staff members are volunteers except for the station manager, business manager and our professional part-time engineer, who each receive nominal monthly salaries.
