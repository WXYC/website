Openers
Hotline TNT
I had not heard of Hotline TNT prior to this show, and I can’t say that their performance left much to be desired. Considering the type of lo-fi, indie rock that Snail Mail is known for, I would’ve expected a similar vibe from the openers.

Hotline TNT is more shoegaze/neo-psychedelic than the bedroom/indie pop that Snail Mail’s earlier releases align with. Although her latest album was more slacker rock, I still don’t quite see how these two acts make sense together. On paper, they don’t seem that different, as they both fall under the indie umbrella, but the overall energy of Hotline TNT was a bit off-putting. The combination of three electric guitars, bass, and drums muddied the vocals (which were pretty far and few between as it is), and evolved into a bit of a cacophony.

As a fan of indie, I was a bit disappointed that I just could not get into this. Although they weren’t my favorite, I could definitely see how someone who likes a bit more high-energy, harsher sounds would have enjoyed this.

Momma
I was heavily anticipating Momma’s performance. With much regret,  I’ve had a bad habit in the past of not giving the openers much listening time prior to seeing them. Fortunately, prior to this concert, I had known about Momma for a few months due to their latest release, “Household Name.” Sometimes I find it difficult to find unique indie music, as the genre has become oversaturated with bands that all sound essentially the same.

Although Momma is not reinventing the wheel and is definitely conforming to the genre, there is something incredibly raw and distinctive about their sound that attracts me. Their sound is reminiscent of early Girlpool records and Chastity Belt (specifically their 2017 release), both of which are some of my favorite indie bands. Momma gets your heart pumping at times with raging guitar riffs, but there’s a consistent thread of sweet melodies that ground the sound and make it irresistible. It’s hard not to get your foot tapping or head nodding to the thick bass lines and punchy riffs.

From my position in the crowd, I watched as Momma, a duo of bleach-blonde indie rockers, enjoyed the previous set by Hotline TNT. You wouldn’t have even realized they were also performing by the way they casually entered the stage and set up their instruments. They had a very humble, yet captivating performance. As a newer band, it’s expected to have a bit of anxiety around performing. They did not interact much with the crowd, but it honestly wasn’t needed.

I think I can speak for most in attendance when saying that their music was a much needed follow-up from Hotline TNT before Snail Mail. Their sound is typical lo-fi indie, but watching them perform live added a whole new layer to their sound. Their passion and energy was very clear through the way they slammed their guitars and spat out their gritty lyrics.

Their setlist could not have been better. They started with “rip off,” which is (non-coincidentally, I’m sure) also the intro to “Household Name”. Most of what they played was from Household Name (besides biohazard and derby), which was nice to hear because I had mainly been listening to their latest album.

Their live performance was almost indistinguishable from their recordings, which was nice, but I do wish they had done more to spice it up. It was also interesting how the duo interacted with each other. Most of the vocals were either one of them singing or the other, opposed to harmonizing together throughout. They did interact a bit with each other, but it seemed disconnected, as if they were two solo acts doing their own thing, but happened to be on the stage together.

Overall, it was a solid performance. I really enjoyed the show, but I could also see how someone who hadn’t listened to their music could have been bored.

Snail Mail
Lindsey Jordan, who goes by the name Snail Mail, has been recording and performing music since 2015. She currently has two full length albums- Lush (2018), and Valentine (2021). She also has one EP- Habit (2016). By 2017, Jordan had signed to Matador Records and was increasing in popularity due to touring with Girlpool, Waxahatchee, and Beach Fossils. Today, I would consider Snail Mail one of the “it girls” of indie music that many fans of the genre would be familiar with.

By the time the two openers had finished, everyone was ready for the main event. For me, this concert was very nostalgic and reminiscent of angsty teenage years, even though many of the songs she played were from her recent album. While her new album has a more developed sound than some of her earlier work, she still has that nostalgic, youthful sound that emulates that feeling of uneasiness and heartbreak. Although she primarily played tracks from her newest album, she didn’t forget to include top tracks from previous releases for fans that have been there since the beginning.

She had a very happy-go-lucky, confident, and energetic demeanor that was extremely captivating. Listening to her recordings, it’s hard to guess how she would perform live. What really made the night memorable was how she really seemed to enjoy performing and playing her music. Some artists feel detached and in their own world, but with Snail Mail, it felt like we were all vibrating at the same frequency. She is truly a seasoned performer who knows how to entertain and interact with the crowd.

While she didn’t add any crazy improvisation to her songs, she sprinkled some of her personality into her music. Even during the sadder tracks, she managed to keep a tongue-in-cheek smile, instilling some boundaries between herself and the gut wrenching lyrics. It was especially humorous when she sang “Mia,” one of her saddest breakup songs, and afterwards stated plainly: “I f*cking hate that b*tch.”

She definitely knows how to lighten the mood. To be clear, I don’t mean that she didn’t perform every song passionately. You could definitely feel that every song was coming from a place of vulnerability and raw emotion, but especially with some older songs you could tell she had grown from the time she wrote them, but perhaps performing them was nostalgic for her as well.

Snail Mail’s setlist was almost perfect. If I could have it my way,  I would’ve added “The 2nd Most Beautiful Girl in the World,” from Habit, but you can’t always get what you want I guess… I will say, “Madonna,” “Forever (sailing),” and “Ben Franklin” may have moved to the top of my list of favorites after this concert. “Madonna” and “Ben Franklin,” both having especially groovy basslines, coupled with the funky, psychedelic, and dreamy tune of “Forever (sailing),” provided moments of reflection and pause between guitar solos and silly dancing. Fans of her earlier work were likely thrilled to hear “Heat Wave,” “Speaking Terms,” “Thinning,” “Full Control,” and “Pristine.” I know I was. Additionally, the inclusion of a Muse cover and “Adore You,” the demo version of the title track “Valentine,” were pleasant, unexpected surprises.

I left Haw River Ballroom after a cozy night of hearing some of my favorite songs, and having gained a new perspective on the artists, as well as their music. I patiently await the next time Snail Mail returns to town, and I recommend any readers who may have missed her this time to attend as well.
