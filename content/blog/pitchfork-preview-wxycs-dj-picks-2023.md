  lineup.

“Julia Jacklin’s my most anticipated performance at Pitchfork this year. Her talent for lyricism married to deeply-felt rhythms populate my favorite tracks from 2022’s Pre-Pleasure and 2019’s Crushing. Wistful ‘End of a Friendship’, anxious ‘Pressure to Party’, and flighty ‘Leadlight’ were my anthems this past year, but I’d love to hear any of her tracks this Saturday.”

“It would be too easy for me to say obvious headliners — The Smile, Big Thief, Bon Iver (all great, all experienced with dynamic discographies and major clout). Though, I truly believe Soul Glo will steal the show. Their latest record on Epitaph, Diaspora Problems, packs quite the punch. With songs like ‘Jump!! (Or Get Jumped!!!)((by the future))’ and ‘Gold Chain Punk (whogonbeatmyass?)’, I anticipate festival crowds fervently reciprocating the energy this band brings to the stage. Culturally, I welcome the visibility of Black Punk, and am eager to see the larger effect this will have on future festival lineups.”

“Big Thief has been my favorite band for the duration of my time in college. Adrianne Lenker, Buck Meek, James Krivchenia and Max Oleartchik are a beautiful embodiment of the trust and imperfection that comes with centering the relationship over the individual in the artistic process. Their experimental folk music can be gentle and whimsical, and it can break you open with the intensity of the human condition itself. They foster a sense of love in the physical space they occupy, and actualize a sense of the sublime at their live shows. Or so I’ve heard. This is going to be my first time seeing them, and I could not be more excited.”

-Hayley, Class of 2024

“I think Jockstrap will be a kicker set. Firstly, what a band name. But the experimental London duo (featuring BC,NR’s Georgia Ellery, who met Taylor Skye at the prestigious Guildhall School of Music) are true electro-pop conniosseurs, as well as in instrumental innovation and sonic variety. I Love You Jennifer B is an elopement of an album, from the yearn of ‘What’s It All About?’ and the heavily cinematic Debra, to the summer sun of ‘Greatest Hits’. They’re just what I’d want from a festival daytime set — fresh, smart, musically sophisticated but with a whole lotta fun. Oh to be on that beserk dancefloor during 50/50…”

-Helena, Class of 2024

“Jockstrap has swiftly become my one of my favorite bands this summer, and if you haven’t heard their music before I truly think they have something for everyone. Their music is just incomparable in my mind to any other artist, it’s weird, fresh, beautiful, experimental, and it is so ridiculously fun for your ears.”

-Anna, Class of 2026

“I first discovered Florist after the release of their self-titled album last year. I listened to it as I unpacked from an extended trip abroad, pausing every other minute to revel in the songs’ beautiful, synth-y melodies and Emily Sprague’s moving tales of love and longing. I find myself repeatedly going back to the tracks ‘Sci-fi Silence,’ ‘Two Ways,’ and ‘Organ’s Drone,’ but if I hear even one of the songs, I will want to listen to the whole album from the beginning. It’s one of those albums you can turn on after a life-altering day to feel understood. Also, a great album to enjoy while observing nature (specifically really cool trees). I’m stoked to watch how the ethereal soundscapes of Florist transform in a live setting at Pitchfork this year, and I can’t wait to see how this group pushes the boundaries of modern folk music with their future projects.”

“If there’s one artist I’m glad is playing at Pitchfork Fest this year, it’s Charlotte-based rapper MAVI. I first heard him on an Earl Sweatshirt song but I became a fan with his 2019 album Let the Sun Talk. His rap is lyric-centric, straddling the line between poetic and hardcore, and unafraid to get emotional. During my first semester at UNC, MAVI made a surprise appearance at a concert for MIKE, as well as Liv.e and Sideshow, at the intimate Cat’s Cradle Backroom. It feels great seeing artists from the Carolinas graduate to huge festivals and crowds like he has.”

-Charlie, Class of 2025


“If MAVI isn’t on your Pitchfork radar, you’re missing out. His latest critically-acclaimed album, Laughing So Hard It Hurts, was on constant repeat for me last winter. Listening to this album is like sitting in a sunbeam, soaking up the warm rays, and popping a vitamin D supplement just for good measure— the perfect antidote to a dark and dreary December. Judging from social media, his live shows appear the same way— exceptionally warm, inviting, and ultimately, an experience you can’t miss.”

-Laura, Class of 2023

“I’m really excited to hear about Grace Ives’ performance this year. Her most recent release, Janky Star instantly became one of my favorite albums from last year after I played it on-air on WXYC. “Lullaby” is one of the catchiest indie pop anthems for teenage yearning. The anthem to my freshman year for sure.”

-Emily, Class of 2026

“Ashville’s MJ Lenderman is certainly one to watch. I’ve had the pleasure of seeing MJ perform five times in my short life. Four times as the guitarist for the alt-country/shoegaze band Wednesday and once as a solo act. With this experience, I can confidently say there is tremendous beauty in moshing to the sound of a lap steel guitar. Lenderman’s critically-acclaimed album, 2022’s Boat Songs, is a buzzing fusion of hard rock intensity and country twang. MJ recounts a specific type of Americana— one laden with 90s sports nostalgia, theme parks, beer and other small joys of life and of love. Standout tracks include ‘You Are Every Girl To Me,’ ‘Taste Just Like It Costs,’ and ‘Hangover Game.’ The most authentic place to listen to MJ Lenderman’s music is by a lake, drinking a beer, but the second best is at Pitchfork Music Festival on July 22nd.”
