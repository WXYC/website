  While studying abroad in Rotterdam, Holland, I had the chance to meet Milan
  Waterhout at a house party in the city’s South. Our conversation quickly
  turned to East Coast US hip-hop, the distinctive DMV flow, and PLUGG music—a
  genre I’m deeply familiar with. Milan revealed he produces PLUGG under the
  name Milanezie through the label Entreprise. A few weeks later, I sat down
  with Milan for an interview at Hogeschool in Central Rotterdam. We delved into
  his music, the history of the PLUGG genre, the vibrant French PLUGG scene,
  internet-driven music culture, the club circuit, and the transatlantic
  influence of Atlanta trap.

So, I first realized when I was talking with some friends from back home that not everyone is on the wave of PLUGG music—a lot of them didn’t even know what it was.  How would you define PLUGG music?

PLUGG,I would say  is really about the beats, so the genre PLUGG is really the instrumental (what I mainly do). The sound really originated from Atlanta. You had this producer called [MexikoDRO](https://genius.com/artists/Mexikodro), and he was inspired by [Zaytoven](https://genius.com/artists/Zaytoven).

I read producers started making PLUGG music in the 2010s?

Yeah, I feel like PLUGG music started in like 2015. [You got the song with Kodak Black and Playboi Carti, PLUGG.](https://youtu.be/_y5wyRPxQzg?si=a0xmeiJvPCzZEW2I) It’s one of the first, like, real PLUGG songs, but really the genre originated on SoundCloud.

I think what made it interesting to me is there is a certain feel of nostalgia to it. There's a lot of use of video game sounds with real trap production--like, say, Zaytoven’s kind of drums.

The genre is very much an internet genre, and you can see it in a lot of things and how it evolved online in just a few years. It's not been out that long and there's even subgenres of the sub-genre.

Yes, like [PLUGGNB](https://soundcloud.com/tags/pluggnb/popular-tracks) and [hyperPLUGG](https://soundcloud.com/tags/hyper%20plugg).

Yeah, hyperPLUGG which is PLUGG with softer sounds, kind of what I've made with some other artists from all over the world.

 It's been becoming more global. First, it was very much Atlanta culture but now it's becoming more of a thing in France as well. People even try it here in the Netherlands. 

It’s becoming bigger because of TikTok as well. In a way, I feel like it's music for people with a low attention span.
