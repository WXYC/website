  While studying abroad in Rotterdam, Holland, I had the chance to meet Milan
  Waterhout at a house party in the city’s South. Our conversation quickly
  turned to East Coast US hip-hop, the distinctive DMV flow, and PLUGG music—a
  genre I’m deeply familiar with. Milan revealed he produces PLUGG under the
  name Milanezie through the label Entreprise. A few weeks later, I sat down
  with Milan for an interview at Hogeschool in Central Rotterdam. We delved into
  his music, the history of the PLUGG genre, the vibrant French PLUGG scene,
  internet-driven music culture, the club circuit, and the transatlantic
  influence of Atlanta trap.

So, I first realized when I was talking with some friends from back home that not everyone is on the wave of PLUGG music—a lot of them didn’t even know what it was.  How would you define PLUGG music?

PLUGG,I would say  is really about the beats, so the genre PLUGG is really the instrumental (what I mainly do). The sound really originated from Atlanta. You had this producer called [MexikoDRO](https://genius.com/artists/Mexikodro), and he was inspired by [Zaytoven](https://genius.com/artists/Zaytoven).

I read producers started making PLUGG music in the 2010s?

Yeah, I feel like PLUGG music started in like 2015. [You got the song with Kodak Black and Playboi Carti, PLUGG.](https://youtu.be/_y5wyRPxQzg?si=a0xmeiJvPCzZEW2I) It’s one of the first, like, real PLUGG songs, but really the genre originated on SoundCloud.

I think what made it interesting to me is there is a certain feel of nostalgia to it. There's a lot of use of video game sounds with real trap production--like, say, Zaytoven’s kind of drums.

The genre is very much an internet genre, and you can see it in a lot of things and how it evolved online in just a few years. It's not been out that long and there's even subgenres of the sub-genre.

Yes, like [PLUGGNB](https://soundcloud.com/tags/pluggnb/popular-tracks) and [hyperPLUGG](https://soundcloud.com/tags/hyper%20plugg).

Yeah, hyperPLUGG which is PLUGG with softer sounds, kind of what I've made with some other artists from all over the world.

 It's been becoming more global. First, it was very much Atlanta culture but now it's becoming more of a thing in France as well. People even try it here in the Netherlands. 

It’s becoming bigger because of TikTok as well. In a way, I feel like it's music for people with a low attention span.

Yeah, because it’s so fast, and loud, you won’t get tired of it.  

What I really like about PLUGG is its instruments. You have PLUGG beats and then you have the way people rap on it which is  very specific as well--different from music you normally hear because it’s with a DMV flow. [DMV flow](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6OHLt4x6PSgv1vn5NTZU4W?si=_PmbEL-AS8GiywpIhNMfJA)’s are just where people rap off beat on purpose.

 You can really define what makes a good PLUGG beat and what makes a bad PLUGG beat. It's still an opinion, but  it's really about limitation. The more you limit or simplify it, the better it gets. It’s very complicated to do it well though, to have limited sounds and still make a really addictive track. The power of PLUGG music is really in its simplicity.

It’s definitely a lot of repetition and looping, I also read that [808s](https://blog.native-instruments.com/808-beats/) are used a lot.

 I feel like before they used a lot of 808s. I use a lot of [sub bass](https://www.edmprod.com/sub-bass/) and really deep bass but with soft and mellow electric pianos and synth sounds. So, it's kind of the balance of the two--like very like hard- hitting stuff with very soft sounds.

I noticed your producer tag in your music is in French instead of Dutch. Why is that?

Nostalgia is a big element of my music, and I just have a love for French culture. I used to vacation a lot to France, when I was a kid. I'm into surfing, so I would always go to the coast, but I also love Paris.

When I listen to French language, I think of vacation. I think of good memories. I also didn't choose a Dutch one because France is a much more global language. And France is next to Holland so makes it makes sense. A lot of people use AB tech saying “I Love \[Insert producer tag]” but I always thought it sounded so corny, so I was like, I'm just going to do it the same thing but in French. 

Also, because the Jetaime thing is such an iconic phrase. So, if I do it well and if I'm the first one to do it, it can become an iconic thing, just like the phrases I love Paris or I love New York.

I wanted something that's catchy and gets people's attention.

Did you pay someone to do it, or did you just get a random person to say it?

No, it's someone I met back in 2018 and it’s just to Snapchat's voice memo.

It's really funny.

What do you think the PLUGG genre seeks to accomplish? Is it more about bringing back a certain aesthetic nostalgia-wise or is it about making something new.

Well, that's a really good question actually. I think it's two things - in the US, it's really about Atlanta rap culture and bringing a sound that people already recognize. But for me, and for people in Holland and France and Germany, European countries, where people are very dogmatic about their music – it's  this very new sound - with the DMV flow going off beat. The DMV on top video game like sounds are so different and new.

So, for me, I'm really trying to bring something new, but it's also a way of bringing references from the US--people I listened to when I was younger from Atlanta.

You said, for example, in France, PLUGG music breaks a lot of rules of traditional music. Does that make it easier for PLUGG music to become mainstream? Or does it thrive on the fact that it's underground or unknown?

It thrives on the fact that it's underground.

I had an interesting conversation about this with my ANR at [Entreprise](https://linkin.bio/labelentreprise/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaaAc7_BpvXalsoWc_xfQtYpo9qOgBAVew37ozhM2kQ7NKuu79RADgtlX94_aem_6aqYnAQVdP1iBtlT1yXhTA), the music label I work with. My label has more indie music, disco, French and Dutch sounds while I make a very American sound., I try to create a kind of blend of these things.

We were talking about the come up of [Daft Punk](https://genius.com/artists/Daft-punk), and he felt like there were a lot of artists like [Kraftwerk](https://genius.com/artists/Kraftwerk), and other people who made this kind of "underground” music. But Daft Punk was really the artist who made people dance to this music, so I still feel like there's lots of possibility with this music.

Something always starts underground before other people like it. If you listen to people like [Yung Lean](https://wildcatchronicle.org/15916/features/celebrating-10-years-of-yung-lean-the-outsider-who-gained-entry/) and [Drain Gang](https://hip-hop-music.fandom.com/wiki/Drain_Gang) both grew such large audiences, but before their sound was very underground and very weird.

I’ve never really listened to the Drain Gang-- except for Yung Lean, because of his  [song with FKA Twigs](https://youtu.be/2N1liztehz8?si=AOKJs8K-FVPt4J-V). But I’ve never met many people who talk about their music. It’s one of those things where, if you go online, down a specific rabbit hole, you’ll find these very specific artists and their fans. I also noticed people online associate this with the way they dress, ‘cause [the drainer or drain gang thing](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Drain),  it's not just music, it's an appearance or “vibe”.

Yeah, it’s all so connected. I'm just a music lover and I love to bring some controversy with my music in a way. I work with [Serane](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2juymGEgJZTvtxOcnCWY17?si=ObujpgXnS2SRTd5wjgBUjQ) a lot. He's a French artist.

I often wonder if he's going to stay underground because we really make music for certain people.

I think it's very interesting because fashion is so connected with his music. He actually used to be a model before making music, and he’s really connected to the fashion industry and always tries to do something new. He describes it as "drip auditif”. It's [drip](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drip), but for your ears. 

So, you make music that sounds good but also looks good.

Right., When I find new PLUGG artists I don't just listen to the quality of the music. I'll look more at how they look.  What is their vision? You're bringing a whole world into your music. On TikTok, I found a lot of great PLUGG songs, but then I look at the artist’s profile and I don’t see the vision or a brand.

You can also create an identity in your music through your beat selection. I like to listen to music, ‘cause of the producer a lot of times. There are certain producers who work very closely with certain artists, and I started to like the music of the artist because it's more connected and cohesive.

I really enjoy listening to producer projects. If an artist is very connected with a producer, it's better music, a lot of the time. There's this artist, [Nelick](https://entreprisemusique.fr/nelick/), he’s a French artist signed to the label. He's dropping his first album in the coming month, and he'll be very connected with my best friend and main collaborator [Kofi Bae](https://entreprisemusique.fr/kofi-bae/).

I've seen.

They're really orchestrating the whole tape together, which makes it so powerful. It’s not just a producer, and it’s not just the artist. The producer (Kofi Bae) didn't initially produce every song, but he touched every song in a way. So, every time he reproduced some sounds you can hear his signature in the track, which is really dope, I think.

Do you think it makes an album more cohesive if you have a singular producer the entire way?

Well, when I make music with the entrepreneurs I work with, I compose some beats, and I show it to them, and they're like, "this is a cool idea”, and I record artists on it to create a demo. 

Then I work with an audio engineer, and we get into the realization process - that's when we start with the mixing also but also record more stuff on top of the instrumentals. That’s how I work with Nelick, the artist I talked about, dropping his first album. He recorded a track on someone else's beat but then rerecorded with Kofi Bae and a sound engineer, during the realization process and then they recorded more synths and sounds on top of the beat.

When you go through the process of producing a song at the end, does it ever feel satisfying when you listen to the final product?

I feel satisfied, but it hasn't always been like that. I think it's different when you're the artist on the song and versus when you're a producer. If you're the producer, you're less connected always.

If you're dropping your own like project and making a song for it, you're super connected to it. 

It takes me months-- sometimes even a year-- to  have the full project produced.

[My first project](https://musicboard.app/album/la-nuit-porte-conseil-2/milanezie/) that I'm proud of dropped back in October and I'm still proud of it. But I don't know how that’ll change over five years. I don’t know what I would want to change.

I've been posting a lot on YouTube with [#typebeats](https://blog.landr.com/type-beats/), about 1500 beats on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Milanezie/featured).

Damn.

I'm just releasing tracks to get feedback  'cause I know a lot of artists who just keep their stuff on their hard disc but then it becomes  hard to improve them. You don't know how people perceive it, and you don't really create a sound if you don't make a lot of music.

Yeah, I saw on SoundCloud you were pushing out stuff even like a few days ago.

Yeah, and I have an interesting story. There’s this popular French rap artists named, [Booba](https://genius.com/artists/Booba).

He’ll beef with anyone on Twitter, okay. So there was this interview with Serane, the main artist I collaborate with, on Apple Music. The show is called [Le Code with Mehdi Maïzi, ](https://music.apple.com/us/curator/le-code-radio-avec-mehdi-ma%C3%AFzi/1508024265) and it's a big opinion leader in music in France.

Booba got so mad that someone like him (Serane) got this attention on the show. “Like what the \*\*\*\*? This is not hip hop?” He said, like, the worst things about him. 

So, I posted on Twitter, “Thanks Booba for the opportunity” and I put  his voice on a PLUGG beat. I just grabbed his biggest song off YouTube and used a new stem extractor on  FL Studio to separate stems and vocals.

Then my friend recorded a video of me in the studio with a Burberry scarf.![](/uploads/Picture2.png)

Oh my god.

This online storm started, and I put the song on SoundCloud. Right now it’s got like 25,000 streams, and for my SoundCloud that's big because I'm inactive on there.

After that, I decided to do more PLUGG remixes of French classic songs, since it was such a success. And since PLUGG music is not big in France, I thought if the artist doesn't come to me, I'll just come to the artist. Just grab their song and put it over a PLUGG beat.

I feel like I haven't asked you any personal questions about who you are. What does music mean to you?

I'm Milan. I'm 24 years old. I live in Rotterdam, Holland. When I was a kid, I played violin for  6 years and piano for maybe 3 years. I never really had the motivation to make music until 2017.

There were Dutch artists who started making hip-hop music in 2015, when hip hop kind of came up in Holland. When I heard these new waves of hip-hop music, I started to find my kind of music. 

Who are your influences or favorite artists?

I listen to a lot of Dutch music like, [Yung Internet](https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/yung_internet), [Joost Klein](https://genius.com/artists/Joost), the guy who's going to Eurovision for Holland now this year.
