  While studying abroad in Rotterdam, Holland, I had the chance to meet Milan
  Waterhout at a house party in the city’s South. Our conversation quickly
  turned to East Coast US hip-hop, the distinctive DMV flow, and PLUGG music—a
  genre I’m deeply familiar with. Milan revealed he produces PLUGG under the
  name Milanezie. A few weeks later, I sat down with Milan for an interview at
  Hogeschool in Central Rotterdam. We delved into his music, the history of the
  PLUGG genre, the vibrant French PLUGG scene, internet-driven music culture,
  the club circuit, and the transatlantic influence of Atlanta trap.
---

**So, I first realized when I was talking with some friends from back home that not everyone is on the wave of PLUGG music—a lot of them didn’t even know what it was. How would you define PLUGG music?**

PLUGG,I would say  is really about the beats, so the genre PLUGG is really the instrumental (what I mainly do). The sound really originated from Atlanta. You had this producer called [MexikoDRO](https://genius.com/artists/Mexikodro), and he was inspired by [Zaytoven](https://genius.com/artists/Zaytoven).

**I read producers started making PLUGG music in the 2010s?**

Yeah, I feel like PLUGG music started in like 2015. [You got the song with Kodak Black and Playboi Carti, PLUGG.](https://youtu.be/_y5wyRPxQzg?si=a0xmeiJvPCzZEW2I) It’s one of the first, like, real PLUGG songs, but really the genre originated on SoundCloud.

I think what made it interesting to me is there is a certain feel of nostalgia to it. There's a lot of use of video game sounds with real trap production--like, say, Zaytoven’s kind of drums.

The genre is very much an internet genre, and you can see it in a lot of things and how it evolved online in just a few years. It's not been out that long and there's even subgenres of the sub-genre.

**Yes, like [PLUGGNB](https://soundcloud.com/tags/pluggnb/popular-tracks) and [hyperPLUGG](https://soundcloud.com/tags/hyper%20plugg).**

Yeah, softPLUGG which is PLUGG with softer sounds, kind of what I've made with some other artists from all over the world.

 It's been becoming more global. First, it was very much Atlanta culture but now it's becoming more of a thing in France as well. People even try it here in the Netherlands. 

It’s becoming bigger because of TikTok as well. In a way, I feel like it's music for people with a low attention span.

**Yeah, because it’s so fast, and loud, you won’t get tired of it.** 

What I really like about PLUGG is its instruments. You have PLUGG beats and then you have the way people rap on it which is  very specific as well--different from music you normally hear because it’s with a DMV flow. [DMV flow](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6OHLt4x6PSgv1vn5NTZU4W?si=_PmbEL-AS8GiywpIhNMfJA)’s are just where people rap off beat on purpose.

 You can really define what makes a good PLUGG beat and what makes a bad PLUGG beat. It's still an opinion, but  it's really about limitation. The more you limit or simplify it, the better it gets. It’s very complicated to do it well though, to have limited sounds and still make a really addictive track. The power of PLUGG music is really in its simplicity.

**It’s definitely a lot of repetition and looping, I also read that [808s](https://blog.native-instruments.com/808-beats/) are used a lot.**

 I feel like before they used a lot of 808s. I use a lot of [sub bass](https://www.edmprod.com/sub-bass/) and really deep bass but with soft and mellow electric pianos and synth sounds. So, it's kind of the balance of the two--like very like hard- hitting stuff with very soft sounds.

**What do you think the PLUGG genre seeks to accomplish? Is it more about bringing back a certain aesthetic nostalgia-wise or is it about making something new.**

Well, that's a really good question actually. I think it's two things - in the US, it's really about Atlanta rap culture and bringing a sound that people already recognize. But for me, and for people in Holland and France and Germany, European countries, where people are very dogmatic about their music – it's  this very new sound - with the DMV flow going off beat. The DMV on top video game like sounds are so different and new.

So, for me, I'm really trying to bring something new, but it's also a way of bringing references from the US--people I listened to when I was younger from Atlanta.

**You said, for example, in France, PLUGG music breaks a lot of rules of traditional music. Does that make it easier for PLUGG music to become mainstream? Or does it thrive on the fact that it's underground or unknown?**

It thrives on the fact that it's underground.

I had an interesting conversation about this with my ANR at [Entreprise](https://linkin.bio/labelentreprise/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaaAc7_BpvXalsoWc_xfQtYpo9qOgBAVew37ozhM2kQ7NKuu79RADgtlX94_aem_6aqYnAQVdP1iBtlT1yXhTA), the music label I work with. My label has more indie music, disco, French and Dutch sounds while I make a very American sound., I try to create a kind of blend of these things.

We were talking about the come up of [Daft Punk](https://genius.com/artists/Daft-punk), and he felt like there were a lot of artists like [Kraftwerk](https://genius.com/artists/Kraftwerk), and other people who made this kind of "underground” music. But Daft Punk was really the artist who made people dance to this music, so I still feel like there's lots of possibility with this music.

Something always starts underground before other people like it. If you listen to people like [Yung Lean](https://wildcatchronicle.org/15916/features/celebrating-10-years-of-yung-lean-the-outsider-who-gained-entry/) and [Drain Gang](https://hip-hop-music.fandom.com/wiki/Drain_Gang) both grew such large audiences, but before their sound was very underground and very weird.

**I’ve never really listened to the Drain Gang-- except for Yung Lean, because of his  [song with FKA Twigs](https://youtu.be/2N1liztehz8?si=AOKJs8K-FVPt4J-V). But I’ve never met many people who talk about their music. It’s one of those things where, if you go online, down a specific rabbit hole, you’ll find these very specific artists and their fans. I also noticed people online associate this with the way they dress, ‘cause [the drainer or drain gang thing](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Drain),  it's not just music, it's an appearance or “vibe”.**

Yeah, it’s all so connected. I'm just a music lover and I love to bring some controversy with my music in a way. I work with [Serane](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2juymGEgJZTvtxOcnCWY17?si=ObujpgXnS2SRTd5wjgBUjQ) a lot. He's a French artist.

I often wonder if he's going to stay underground because we really make music for certain people.

I think it's very interesting because fashion is so connected with his music. He actually used to be a model before making music, and he’s really connected to the fashion industry and always tries to do something new. He describes it as "drip auditif”. It's [drip](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drip), but for your ears. 

**So, you make music that sounds good but also looks good.**

Right. When I find new PLUGG artists I don't just listen to the quality of the music. I'll look more at how they look.  What is their vision? You're bringing a whole world into your music. On TikTok, I found a lot of great PLUGG songs, but then I look at the artist’s profile and I don’t see the vision or a brand.

You can also create an identity in your music through your beat selection. I like to listen to music, ‘cause of the producer a lot of times. There are certain producers who work very closely with certain artists, and I started to like the music of the artist because it's more connected and cohesive.

I really enjoy listening to producer projects. If an artist is very connected with a producer, it's better music, a lot of the time. There's this artist, [Nelick](https://entreprisemusique.fr/nelick/), he’s a French artist signed to the label. He's dropping his first album in the coming month, and he'll be very connected with my best friend and main collaborator [Kofi Bae](https://entreprisemusique.fr/kofi-bae/).

**I've seen.**

They're really orchestrating the whole tape together, which makes it so powerful. It’s not just a producer, and it’s not just the artist. The producer (Kofi Bae) didn't initially produce every song, but he touched every song in a way. So, every time he reproduced some sounds you can hear his signature in the track, which is really dope, I think.

**Do you think it makes an album more cohesive if you have a singular producer the entire way?**

Well, when I make music with the entrepreneurs I work with, I compose some beats, and I show it to them, and they're like, "this is a cool idea”, and I record artists on it to create a demo. 

Then I work with an audio engineer, and we get into the realization process - that's when we start with the mixing also but also record more stuff on top of the instrumentals. That’s how I work with Nelick, the artist I talked about, dropping his first album. He recorded a track on someone else's beat but then rerecorded with Kofi Bae and a sound engineer, during the realization process and then they recorded more synths and sounds on top of the beat.

**When you go through the process of producing a song at the end, does it ever feel satisfying when you listen to the final product?**

I feel satisfied, but it hasn't always been like that. I think it's different when you're the artist on the song and versus when you're a producer. If you're the producer, you're less connected always.

If you're dropping your own like project and making a song for it, you're super connected to it. 

It takes me months-- sometimes even a year-- to  have the full project produced.

[My first project](https://musicboard.app/album/la-nuit-porte-conseil-2/milanezie/) that I'm proud of dropped back in October and I'm still proud of it. But I don't know how that’ll change over five years. I don’t know what I would want to change.

I've been posting a lot on YouTube with [#typebeats](https://blog.landr.com/type-beats/), about 1500 beats on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Milanezie/featured).

**Damn.**

I'm just releasing tracks to get feedback 'cause I know a lot of artists who just keep their stuff on their hard disc but then it becomes hard to improve them. You don't know how people perceive it, and you don't really create a sound if you don't make a lot of music.

**Yeah, I saw on SoundCloud you were pushing out stuff even like a few days ago.**

**I feel like I haven't asked you any personal questions about who you are. What does music mean to you?**

I'm Milan. I'm 24 years old. I live in Rotterdam, Holland. When I was a kid, I played violin for  6 years and piano for maybe 3 years. I never really had the motivation to make music until 2017.

There were Dutch artists who started making hip-hop music in 2015, when hip hop kind of came up in Holland. When I heard these new waves of hip-hop music, I started to find my kind of music. 

**Who are your influences or favorite artists?**

I listen to a lot of Dutch music like, [Yung Internet](https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/yung_internet), [Joost Klein](https://genius.com/artists/Joost), the guy who's going to Eurovision for Holland now this year.

I had the opportunity to work with him, which is insane to me.

I liked the way he approached hip hop, using a lot of word play and jokes (dad jokes). I love to make bad word play jokes and stuff like that. People got so tired of me, so I just decided to write them in my notes. I started using GarageBand and found some beats on YouTube. I would just rap over them with my jokes. This was a way for me to express myself, and how I started to fall more in love with music.

In 2019, I was like, no, I really want this music stuff to work for me and to do some stuff internationally, because it’s just cool to me. I want other people to enjoy my vision and music. That's when I started producing.

One of my first beats was  also the start of my YouTube channel. So quite fast. I was like, OK, you know,  I need to get my music out there on YouTube, and from March 2019 to the end of 2021, I uploaded almost every single day.

**Do you find that PLUGG artists/producers have an easy or difficult time staying relevant? I feel like there's a lot of them that come out all the time?**

Very difficult. 

I mean, there are some artists like  [D.Savage](https://genius.com/artists/D-savage) and [Diego Money](https://genius.com/artists/Diego-money) who are kind of the originators of this genre of rapping on these kinds of beats. They're always a classic, but they're not as relevant as they used to be.  I feel like the power of the genre is that you have to stay renewable since the music sometimes sounds the same. 

\*\*I feel the same way – it has to be a PLUGG format that’s recognizable but original, which seems hard to pull off. \*\*

I think if something sounds similar to the work you did in the past, that's a strong thing. A lot of people say things like, no, I don't want to make something that sounds like something I already made. But me, I aim to make something that sounds like something I already made because that’s how you develop a signature sound.

**I noticed with your most recent drop it sounded very different.**

With my most recent drop, I tried to find a different path. I'm walking the producer path, for which I'm mostly known, which is just a similar kind of PLUGG beat all the time but really pushing it out like a factory making a whole bunch of beats. An industry way of working, but with an underground kind of music.

Now the music I'm trying to put out is more produced and more thought through on the artistic side of things.

I sit on these songs for days before I'm satisfied. It's a different way of working.

Kofi Bae, the guy I work with, is from a really different field of music. He's really into, like, disco and pop music,and I'm really into trap and hip hop. We’re working together using both our ways of making music to make something special. For instance, our project, Le Nuit Porte Conseil, has a melancholic vibe and is more about feeling lonely in the club.

I’ve had interviews about the project and people said it’s like going on a night out with Kofi and I, from morning to the end of the night.

The last track on that album, Le train ne passe pas deux fois (The train doesn't pass twice), is really about the feeling of being in the club.

I like to delve into the club environment in the lyrics – it’s an interesting environment because, metaphorically, I would say it’s like being in a class with a whole bunch of new people.

There's a hierarchy, so many interactions all in one space - it’s like a one-night life. And then the next day, everyone is just moving on.

**Yeah. And you forget everything.**

So, the song, Le train ne passe pas deux fois, is about this kind of time pressure. You meet someone in the club, have a good time, and then they’re out of your life once you leave.

A lot of club music is about flexing or not caring, but Kofi and I are both very traditional when it comes to romance. So, trying to find a fit between the fast flex club culture and traditional romantic ideals is the basis of the song.

**Yeah, you're trying to have a sacred space in the club. Sometimes I think the club is like the pinnacle of human interaction, it's so funny to be there. You get to see people in all different states. People care, but they don't. You get to talk to people in a way you never talk to people in real life.**

You see people in their purest form sometimes, and  it's a way for people to forget their daily life – like a dreamy escape. I feel like my music is very dreamy, and I would describe myself as a dreamy person as well, in my head and thinking a lot. I think PLUGG is a very dream-like genre as well.

**It’s your personality, but do you still have to be disciplined in that genre?**

I don’t think so. We try to find a fit of PLUGG music and more dance music. So, we might have a disco track with a DMV flow kind of rap on it. We also mix the vocals in ways that go against industry standards.

I wanted the vocals to be a bit lower than the beat. On the tracks, I didn't write the tracks myself because I'm singing myself, and I really want to be like a pop star.  But on the other tracks where we invited rappers, I really, really wanted to give it that PLUGG sound, give it that nonchalance in rapping and in writing.
