Join WXYC, Ouvert Collective, and the UNC Beat Lab this Tuesday for a crash course on all things DJing. We'll cover essential DJ history, need-to-know technology and mixing tips and DJ etiquette. During the second half of the workshop, we'll provide time for practice on professional-grade equipment. No experience is necessary. Open to everyone!\
