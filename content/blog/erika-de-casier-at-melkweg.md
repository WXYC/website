Since this past March, Erika de Casier, the Portuguese-born Danish singer, songwriter, and record producer, has been gracing stages across the US and Canada on her ‘Still’ Tour, culminating in a headlining spot at Coachella this past April. Despite having to brave the rain-drenched streets of Amsterdam, I had the pleasure of catching her in the European leg of her tour, at Melkweg this past Saturday. Opening for her were the dynamic duo, Kiss Facility, comprising the Irish-Chilean singer-songwriter and producer, Sega Bodega (Salvador Navarette), and the half Egyptian-Salvadorian Emirati-born vocalist, Mayah Alkhateri.




While I had stumbled upon Kiss Facility's tracks on Spotify before, experiencing Alkhateri's vocals live was an entirely different experience. Singing primarily in Arabic, though I couldn't grasp every word, the emotion and power behind her vocals were unmistakable. Navarette (Sega Bodega) provided a solid bassline that filled the intimate venue, adding depth to Alkhateri's performance. Despite being familiar with Sega Bodega's independent tracks and production work on Shygirl's albums, seeing him on stage was a revelation. What I initially took for Alkhateri's guitarist turned out to be one of my most listened-to artists.




The duo performed around five songs, with standout performances including 'In My Room,' a poignant Arabic track expressing Alkhateri's love for life tinged with despair, and 'Black Stone,' a personal piece delving into the Egyptian concept of evil and the desire to protect loved ones. Despite their relatively short stage time, their performance left a lasting impression, and I'll be eagerly awaiting their future shows.




Shortly after, de Casier took the stage in a laid-back tee and long sleeves, delivering her signature sultry pop, jazz, and soft trap-infused tracks from her latest 2024 release, 'Still,' as well as selections from her earlier groundbreaking albums, 'Sensational' and 'Essentials.' What struck me about de Casier's songwriting was her ability to weave simple narratives about romantic relationships while infusing them with playful wit, inviting the audience to both relate and reflect on her understated lyrics.




Her performance was equally tasteful, with simple yet sensual background imagery of waves and streets creating a cozy yet captivating atmosphere. From crowd favorites like 'Photo of You' and 'Friendly' to collaborations like 'Twice' with the beloved Blood Orange (Dev Hynes), de Casier showcased her talent and range throughout the approximately hour-long set, leaving no room for disappointment.




While I thoroughly enjoyed myself at Melkweg, my only complaint was that it wasn't longer, as de Casier returned for just one more song during the encore. The concert, starting promptly at 8:00 PM and wrapping up at 10:00, mirrored de Casier's style of short and sweet artistry. To me, this concert was a master class in authenticity and the power of intentionality, deepening my appreciation for both de Casier's and Kiss Facility's discography.
