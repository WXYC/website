“Counting down the seasons till I see you again, winter is me singing in my room it never ends,” croons WXYC alum Audrey Keelin on Hiding Places’ new single, “Crown of Tin.”

“Crown of Tin” is the first single off of the band’s upcoming third EP, which was produced by Asheville-based musician Colin Miller, who has worked with acclaimed NC indie acts such as Wednesday, MJ Lenderman and Indigo De Souza. The EP is slated for release in early 2024. 

Hiding Places consists of Keelin (guitar and vocals), Anthony Cozzarelli (bass guitar), Nicholas Byrne (guitar and vocals) and Henry Cutting (drums). Though the group was originally formed in Chapel Hill, they are now split between North Carolina and New York.

Keelin met Byrne through the WXYC listserv in 2019, and the two began exchanging music shortly thereafter. “Crown of Tin” was the first track Keelin ever sent to Byrne, and has now been re-recorded nearly ten times. 

The song was initially released as a demo on the Hiding Places [Bandcamp](https://hidingplacesnc.bandcamp.com/) in October 2019. Keelin describes the writing process as taking place “at a desk underneath their first-year university dorm room bunk bed, fighting off feelings of homesickness and instead throwing themselves into learning Garageband,” a relatable sentiment for many creatives at UNC. 

“Crown of Tin” begins much like the 2019 demo, with Keelin’s vocals standing out, warm and crackling over acoustic guitar and the occasional backup harmony. Soon, however, the track crescendos into a cathartic, booming finale, with punching drums and distorted electric guitar. It feels like a much-needed expulsion of pent-up energy – like a sad, frustrated sigh of relief.

“The vocal takes we included on the song are the first vocal takes I ever did on the song,” Keelin said. “And honestly, I was really stream-of-consciousness-ing it.” 

It’s a melancholic, yearning track with a touch of hope. It feels like finding beauty and comfort in sadness and loneliness and appreciating the feelings while they’re there. Keelin sings of wanting to run away to live inside of a tent and make friends with animals all while acknowledging the small joys in their everyday collegiate routine, like having picnics with their friends and “taking a short dance under the sun.”
