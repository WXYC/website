Since the debut of their first studio album, Masterpiece, folk-rock band, Big Thief, has left a lasting impression on listeners and critics, intertwining compelling and evocative lyricism with emotive instrumentals and the devastatingly beautiful wonder that is Adrianne Lenker’s voice. Comprised of Lenker, guitarist Buck Meek, drummer James Krivchenia, and bassist Max Oleartchik, the group has produced four albums, the most recent three named “Best New Music” by Pitchfork. 

The band embarked on a month-long North American tour this fall, performing at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh on September 23rd. Thursday evening heralded the arrival of autumn; crisp air and sweeping shadows of darkness transformed the evening’s pinks and blues from blushing, mellow hues of North Carolina sunsets into the vibrant illumination of stage lights.  

Fortunately, I scored a spot in the first row in front of the stage before most people realized that the pit was open to general admission. Notorious for sitting on the ground anywhere and everywhere, I took a seat on the concrete below and became so immersed in scribbling in my journal that it took a second to register the explosion of cheers as Meek, Krivchenia, Oleartchik, and Lenker took their places onstage from left to right and swiftly picked up their instruments. Without saying a word, they glanced subtly at one another and dove right in. Clutching the metal gate in front of me with one hand, and my friend’s shoulder with the other, I leaned in. 

Instantly captivating the audience with “Change,” an unreleased song debuted on Instagram earlier this year, the band transformed a seemingly impersonal venue hosting a crowd of strangers into a welcoming, intimate space. I felt hypnotized as we stood there beaming, “Change” synonymous with the feeling of a breath of fresh air that opened the lungs in preparation for what was yet to come. It wasn’t until after performing ten songs that Lenker first spoke, laughing, then thanking the audience for being there. “I’m trying to feel feelings and feel many things,” she said, pausing to drink from a mug that had been resting on the ground, then picking back up with “Cattails.” As Oleartchik clapped his hands into the microphone and a smiling Krivchenia bounced on his stool, a singular moth fluttered above, absorbing the energy and momentum that saturated the air. “Magic is real,” my friend Audrey whispered.  

The setlist included a satisfying assortment from all four studio albums, evocative time capsules of Big Thief’s evolution as a band over the years. Fan favorites including “Shark Smile,” “Masterpiece,” and “Not” evoked in the crowd a euphonious cacophony of scream-singing to all of the words. In addition to their well-known and well-loved repertoire, Big Thief performed “Certainty,” a recent single, and shared with the audience several new and unreleased titles including “Simulation Swarm,” and “Dried Roses,” which debuted this year via live streams. 

As the show began to wrap up, Lenker introduced “Promise is a Pendulum,” a new song that she likes, she told the audience. Silence swept over the crowd as all eyes fixated in awe on Lenker’s moving vocals and delicate fingerpicking, her solo moment also revealing the band’s overwhelming respect for her; Meek stood with his hands detached from his guitar, Oleartchik sat on the floor, and Krivchenia relaxed on his stool with one foot perched on the bass drum. Facing Lenker, they gazed in admiration, not once failing to take their eyes off her. 

The most notable aspect of Big Thief’s performance was the intimate dynamic between all four members. Ceaselessly in sync and communicating instinctively via nods, glances, and smiles, they’d locked eyes with one another while fusing each individual sound; Krivchenia’s entrancing, ardent drumbeat, Meek’s enthralling guitarwork, Oleartchik’s vibrantly rhythmic and grounding bass, and Lenker’s tender, but striking voice. At certain points, they would walk towards center stage until they were facing each other in a circle, absorbed in a world of their own, playing with and for one another. The chemistry between them was magnetic, pouring surreal energy into the physical space and sweeping the audience into a world that felt almost transcendental.   

For the finale, Big Thief performed a full-band rendition of “Mary.” Although distinct in sound from the recording, which interweaved vocals with organ and piano, the live performance preserved the haunting tone of the original version. After setting down their instruments, the band walked offstage, silent in comparison to the deafening roar of the crowd. We cheered without pause for what felt like at least five minutes, but the hopes for an encore slowly faded as the stage remained empty. Nevertheless, the clapping and screaming never let up in its intensity, and Big Thief re-emerged to play one last song. “Forgotten Eyes” may have been the most fitting encore, closing the show with the band and the crowd singing in perfect unison.
