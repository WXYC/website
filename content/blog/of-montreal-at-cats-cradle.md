“When people ask me my gender, I just tell them brunette,”
were the lyrics that stuck with me the most throughout Of Montreal’s show at Cat’s Cradle. “Marjuana’s a Working Woman” had me filled with such love for my body and identity. It was the theme of the entire night; a love letter to queerness and dance.

This psychedelic journey began with the lovely opener Locate S,1. I came into the opener blind and was pleasantly surprised. Christina Schneider, singer-songwriter of Locate S,1, has the voice of a folk angel. Not an exaggeration. She sounds like how it would feel to frolic in a field while collecting little fun trinkets on the way. Her sound is a combination of soft light-hearted noise and exciting pop, all backed by her gentle airy voice. If you like Faye Webster, Alvvays, and even Weyes Blood, Locate S,1 might be your next favorite indie artist.

Then Of Montreal took the stage. Never in my life have I seen a concert with such odd theatrical elements…odd in the best way possible. My jaw dropped when two strange looking characters in skeleton costumes ran onto stage to introduce the band, led by singer Kevin Barnes and supported by Clayton Rychlik, Jojo Glidewell, and Ross Brand. Upon their entrance, the crowd began going absolutely insane. I knew if this is how they’re starting the show, I’m in for a treat.

I don’t even know where to begin. I truly was speechless after this concert, partly because of how beautifully it was done. Each song had its own performance; I felt like I went to 10 different shows in one. The two characters from the beginning of the show would come back approximately every other song, but with whole new outfits. These weren’t just any ordinary dance outfits…they were eclectic and off-putting. The elaborate masks, bodysuits, and crazy makeup made me feel so free and accepted as a person, actually. Those wacky elements really fostered a welcoming space for me to be myself. I felt so loved. The songs such as “Paranoiac Intervals/Body Dysmorphia” and “Blab Sabbath Lathe of Maiden” discussed sexuality in a way I haven’t seen in new music today. It was blunt and open, emphasizing how free it is to speak what’s on your mind.

My absolute favorite part was how incredibly strong the stage presence was, which effortlessly engaged the audience. Everyone busted a move without a care in the world. Lead singer Kevin Barnes took the time to interact with the crowd. They were BORN to perform. If I had to use only one word to describe this concert, it would unquestionably be “HEALING.” It was healing in the way I could express my identity in the crowd without worrying about judgement. It was healing in the way I felt so loved as a part of the queer community. Moreover, the sheer, unadulterated joy this performance brought me was profoundly healing.
