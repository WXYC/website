The universe seemed to smile upon Raleigh as Khruangbin harnessed the power of simplicity and mellow jams for their set on June 11 at Red Hat Amphitheater. Promoting their fifth studio album “A LA SALA,” the tour marked their 10th anniversary as a band.

John Carroll Kirby opened with a flute-centric performance that felt like an exotic elevator music celebration. The giddiness of his group’s set created an infectious atmosphere as attendees in floral prints and cowboy hats wafted into the space.

Once Khruangbin took to the stage, the sunset began to peak behind them, setting the tone for the evening ahead. Their melodies were tight and recognizable as ever, but the dimension of the amphitheater gave their songs space to resonate in a way that studio recordings can’t capture.

Over a decade after the Houston-based three-piece released their debut single “A Calf Born in Winter,” the band has perfected their relaxed pace and cool factor. The stage, reminiscent of the album cover, featured a backdrop with three windows displaying dynamic visuals. The first set featured the entirety of “A LA SALA.” Fog machines built up the atmosphere as guitarist Mark Speer and bassist Laura Lee circled each other like tigers on the hunt, their movement effortless and mesmerizing.

With the album’s final track, “Les Petits Gris,” came a set break that emulated a thunderstorm through lights and sound. The trio launched into an energetic second set featuring a range of fan favorites from their catalog. They played through them with seamless transitions – it was an extended jam featuring breakbeat rhythms from DJ Johnson on drums and riffs that had everyone up out of their seats faster than you could say “Pelota.” The groove kept going with “Maria También,” followed by “Evan Finds The Third Room” and a resounding finish with “People Everywhere (Still Alive).”

The electrified crowd demanded an encore, and I felt spoiled by their three-song return to the stage, featuring a spacey rendition of “White Gloves,” followed by “So We Won’t Forget” and a triumphant finish with “Time (You and I).” The trio gave a better show than one could have hoped for, and I cannot wait to catch their next tour.
