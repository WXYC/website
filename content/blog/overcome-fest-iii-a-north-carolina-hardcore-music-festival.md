THE DAY IS MINE - THE NIGHT IS ALSO MINE. This line, from New Jersey hardcore band E. Town Concrete, was probably quoted more in North Carolina on the first weekend in May than any time before and adequately summed up the electric energy and excitement of Overcome Fest III, North Carolina’s very own hardcore music festival. Hosted in Winston Salem, the two full days of hardcore music were made possible by Blind Path Booking, a local hardcore booking agency run by a treasured member of the scene, and Winston-Salem band Ends of Sanity, one of the pillars of modern North Carolina hardcore. The festival brought together an incredible lineup of local bands and hardcore acts from all over the US and Canada. North Carolinian hardcore enthusiasts, as well as travelers from scenes near and far, came out in force to enjoy a beautiful weekend of community, music, and hardcore dancing.

Day one took place at Hoots Beer Co, a regular host for Winston-Salem hardcore shows. The smell of $5 “Overcome Burgers” cooking outside, the noise of bands sound checking, and the sight of hundreds of hardcore fans greeting each other and checking out Madd Vintage’s t-shirt display set the scene for the beginning of an amazing weekend. The first day featured Spirit of Vengeance (Toronto, Canada), Shogun (Knoxville, Tennessee), Divine Right (Charlotte, North Carolina), Fading Signal (Raleigh, North Carolina), Eyez Wide Shut (Raleigh, North Carolina), Invoke (Wilmington, North Carolina), Three Knee Deep (Tampa, Florida), and E. Town Concrete (Elizabeth, New Jersey). Knife Wound from Atlanta, Georgia had to drop the show at the last minute, but the band’s leadman still made it to North Carolina and moshed for every band. The masterfully crafted lineup delivered a great range of different hardcore styles, from the more metal-leaning to classic hardcore to hip-hop influenced vocal flow over chugging guitars. E. Town Concrete headlined the first night, playing to an enthusiastic crowd still very much up to stagediving and mic-grabbing at 11pm after hours on their feet. The incredible energy of every band and the dedication of the crowd to show up, come inside, and dance/stage dive/grab the mic for every act made for an amazing day of music from beginning to end.

Day two brought hardcore to a new location in North Carolina: Hanesbrands Theater in downtown Winston-Salem. Although more accustomed to hosting theater productions and dance groups, the huge open room, surrounding balcony, and low stage (perfect stage diving height) provided a perfect venue for a full day of hardcore. Day two featured Chaos Must Bow (Winston-Salem, North Carolina), Owe You Nothing (Raleigh, North Carolina), Lucky Feeling (Raleigh, North Carolina), Soulless (Waterbury, Connecticut), Risk (Boston, Massachusetts), One by One (Raleigh, North Carolina), Society Sucker (Wilmington, North Carolina), Hold My Own (Chicago, Illinois), D-Bloc (Detroit, Michigan), Naysayer (Richmond, Virginia), Ends of Sanity (Winston-Salem, North Carolina), Lifeless (New Jersey), Advent (Kernersville, North Carolina), Bulldoze (Irvington, New Jersey), and Mindforce (Poughkeepsie, New York).

Once again, North Carolina came out in full force for another magnificent day of hardcore. Everyone was eager to give love to the local favorites and show the out-of-towners what North Carolina Hardcore is all about, packing the room, dancing, and piling on to steal the mic for every band, old and new. Once again, the lineup included something for every kind of hardcore fan, from Bulldoze’s “beatdown” style to Christian metalcore with Advent. New York’s Mindforce closed out the fest with a set full of perhaps the biggest stage pile-ons I have ever seen. Despite ringing ears, sweaty clothes, and a few broken noses and hands from stage diving and dancing, we were reluctant to let the festival come to an end. It had been a fantastic weekend full of music and fellowship, all in our very own beautiful state of North Carolina. Saying goodbye to friends outside the venue, we were comforted and excited by plans for many more local shows to come, and the promise of Overcome Fest IV in the future. I can’t wait to see what North Carolina Hardcore looks like at this time next year. Until then, catch a show in your area, host a gig in your living room, start a band of your own, and listen to North Carolina Hardcore!
