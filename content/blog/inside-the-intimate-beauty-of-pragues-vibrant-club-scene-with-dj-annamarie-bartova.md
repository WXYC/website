  DJ and local organizer Anna-Marie Bartova (AMB) shared some insight into
  Prague's electric Lunchmeat Festival, the community-driven club scene, and the
  struggle to break into Western media.

Hiding inside the charming Central European capital of the Czech Republic hides a bustling club culture that disrupts the social-media corrupted scene and demands focus on the music and dancing. Within former soap factories, boats, and warehouses, the scene feels like the birth of a new generation of rave culture. Lunchmeat Festival rises above the underground to bring the best of electronic-based music and visual arts to Prague, focusing on the depth of talent from the former Czechoslovak Republic. I sat down outside of Lunchmeat with Anna-Marie Bartova, DJ and organizer, to hear the local insight about the scene and the importance of accessibility.

\*\*Emily:\*\*   I noticed that Lunchmeat \[Festival] really prioritizes affordability and accessibility, which is a very difficult thing to do in the current musical landscape. I'm thinking about a lot of club closures recently, like Watergate in Berlin, for example. How does a festival like Lunchmeat prioritize the people and maintain community during this difficult time?

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* This year, we've introduced a significant change called "Format Shift." Many of our friends couldn't afford to attend Lunchmeat or other cultural events, so we decided to offer a discounted festival pass. Now, you can enjoy four nights for the price of three. We've also launched a 30% discount on one-day tickets for students. Our main goal is to have our friends around us because that's what truly matters. It's unfortunate when they can't join due to financial reasons, and this is our way of addressing that.

\*\*Emily:\*\*  It's an important part of making the culture.

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\*	 Yes, the community yes.

\*\*Emily:\*\*	 Another thing that stood out to me as unique is the heavy incorporation of visuals and effects, not acting as a backdrop to the music, but as an equally important part of the entire production. Why was incorporating the whole sensory experience important in the production of this festival? Or what was your process behind making all of this happen?

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* 	Making all this happen has a long history. It started 15 years ago, at a time when events like this didn’t exist in the Czech Republic. A group of friends, including Jakub Pešek—who is still part of Lunchmeat as the main director and co-founder—felt something was missing. So, they began organizing these unique events. Back then, no one in the Czech Republic had seen anything like it. It was 15 years ago, still in the aftermath of the communist regime. They were among the first to host such events, and small groups of friends started supporting them. Over time, it grew bigger and more professional. Now, 15 years later, it's a completely different experience, not just for us but also for our friends and the audience. When you see the visuals and music connected, it creates a totally different vibe compared to simply dancing in a club with lights. And we love it! The core team of Lunchmeat is a group of nerds who enjoy this kind of thing and love seeing others enjoy it too. That’s what it’s all about for us.

\*\*Emily:\*\* 	Were the offbeat visuals always a part of the festival from the beginning?

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* 	Yes, it has always been deeply connected, and it’s incredibly important to us. That’s why we focus on our commissioned projects, where we bring musicians and visual artists together to create something new for the festivals. We hope these projects can be showcased around the world, and it’s happening. For instance, last year, AXONTORR—a collaboration between Oliver Torr and Simon Kounovski (Axonbody)—was presented at the CTM festival in Germany, Berghain, a festival in Madrid, and even in Rome. Our vision and mission are to present local artists on a global stage.

\*\*Emily:\*\*  I think it really speaks to you staying true to your roots when you see that primarily the artists who are on this lineup are mostly from the Czech Republic or Slovakia.

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* Yes, we try to do that, because the artists from here don't get the attention from the West’s scenes so that's why we are trying to get them to be seen. \*laughs\*

\*\*Emily:\*\*  	As you know, last week I had the pleasure of going to Ankali for the first time. It's easily the most special musical experience I've ever had. There is just such a big sense of community and everyone was smiley and kind, as you say that everyone here is in Prague. What makes the musical community here in Prague different from anywhere else?

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* I’m not sure—it’s hard to pinpoint—but we’re all friends, and the community is small, so everyone knows each other. I love seeing my friends around, and we try to support each other and meet not just in clubs, but outside of them too. There’s definitely something unique about the Prague scene, but it’s difficult to define exactly what makes it special. Maybe it’s the people. Yeah, it’s the people.
