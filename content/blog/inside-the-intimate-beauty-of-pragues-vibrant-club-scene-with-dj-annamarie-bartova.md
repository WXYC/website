  DJ and local organizer Anna-Marie Bartova (AMB) shared some insight into
  Prague's electric Lunchmeat Festival, the community-driven club scene, and the
  struggle to break into Western media.

Hiding inside the charming Central European capital of the Czech Republic hides a bustling club culture that disrupts the social-media corrupted scene and demands focus on the music and dancing. Within former soap factories, boats, and warehouses, the scene feels like the birth of a new generation of rave culture. Lunchmeat Festival rises above the underground to bring the best of electronic-based music and visual arts to Prague, focusing on the depth of talent from the former Czechoslovak Republic. I sat down outside of Lunchmeat with Anna-Marie Bartova, DJ and organizer, to hear the local insight about the scene and the importance of accessibility.

\*\*Emily:\*\*   I noticed that Lunchmeat \[Festival] really prioritizes affordability and accessibility, which is a very difficult thing to do in the current musical landscape. I'm thinking about a lot of club closures recently, like Watergate in Berlin, for example. How does a festival like Lunchmeat prioritize the people and maintain community during this difficult time?

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* This year we have made a huge change called “Format Shift”, because lots of our friends couldn't afford to go to Lunchmeat or to any other cultural events, so that's why we discounted the festival pass. So you can get four nights for the price of three. We also released a discount for students– 30% off the price of the one-day tickets. Because, you know, what we love to see is to see our friends around us and that's the main point. When they can't afford it, it's a pity. Yeah, that's why. 

\*\*Emily:\*\*  It's an important part of making the culture.

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\*	 Yes, the community yes.

\*\*Emily:\*\*	 Another thing that stood out to me as unique is the heavy incorporation of visuals and effects, not acting as a backdrop to the music, but as an equally important part of the entire production. Why was incorporating the whole sensory experience important in the production of this festival? Or what was your process behind making all of this happen?

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* 	Making all this happen… It has a long history. It started 15 years ago, at which time in the Czech Republic there weren't any events like this happening. There was a group of friends with Jakub Pešek…He is still a part of Lunchmeat, he’s the main director and co-founder- and they just missed it here in the Czech Republic, so they started doing these weird events. Back around that time nobody had ever seen it here in the Czech Republic. It was 15 years ago, you know, can you imagine it? It's still after the \[communist] regime and stuff. So they started these events, and they were, I would say, one of the first ones who threw events like this and people, just like small groups of friends, started supporting them and now it's getting bigger and bigger and more professional. And here we are, 15 years after that. It's a completely different experience for us, and also, I hope, for our friends and for the audience. When you see the visuals and the music connected, it's a totally different vibe than when you are in a club dancing only with lights. And we also- we just love it! The core team of Lunchmeat is, I would say, a group of nerds, you know? We enjoy stuff like this and we love to see people enjoying it. We love it, so that is the point.

\*\*Emily:\*\* 	Were the offbeat visuals always a part of the festival from the beginning?

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* 	Yes, always, it was always connected, and it’s super important for us. That’s why we are focusing on our commission projects, which means we’re connecting musicians with visual artists to create something new for the festivals. We also hope that they can showcase or present these projects or these pieces around the world and it's happening. Like last year, I would love to mention [AXONTORR](https://www.instagram.com/axontorr?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==), it's a project from Oliver Torr and Simon Kounovski (Axonbody) and they presented it in Germany at the CTM festival, Berghain, and a festival in Madrid. They were in Rome, too, so that's our vision and our mission: to present local artists around the world.

\*\*Emily:\*\*  I think it really speaks to you staying true to your roots when you see that primarily the artists who are on this lineup are mostly from the Czech Republic or Slovakia.

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* Yes, we try to do that, because the artists from here don't get the attention from the West’s scenes so that's why we are trying to get them to be seen. \*laughs\*

\*\*Emily:\*\*  	As you know, last week I had the pleasure of going to Ankali for the first time. It's easily the most special musical experience I've ever had. There is just such a big sense of community and everyone was smiley and kind, as you say that everyone here is in Prague. What makes the musical community here in Prague different from anywhere else?

\*\*Anna-Marie:\*\* I don't know, it's maybe hard to say, but we are all friends, and the community is small, so everybody knows everyone. I just love to see my friends around, and we are trying to help each other and meet not just in clubs but also outside of clubs. There’s something about the Prague scene, you’re right, but I don’t know if I can specify what makes it special, it’s hard to say. Maybe it's the people, you know. It's the people.
