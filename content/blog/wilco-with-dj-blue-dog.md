As dusk settled over the Live Oak Bank Pavilion, anticipation rose. Tonight Wilco would be taking the stage, performing a testament to their enduring artistry. But before the main act, the opener, Waxatachee, took the stage. Waxahatchee comes from Birmingham, Alabama and her music is primarily alternative-country. Waxahatchee played fan favorites like “Right Back to It” and “Much Ado About Nothing”. These songs brought the crowd in harmony, setting the mood for the night. A night to be full of singing, dancing, and fun for all ages to witness Wilco.

As Waxahatchee left the stage Wilco quickly filled her spot, causing the crowd to boom with excitement. The performance was led by Jeff Tweedy’s vocals as well the lead guitarist Nels Cline, who is responsible for the band's controlled, yet chaotic sound. Cline has jazz and rock influences, which allows for his sound to let loose, and it does. This chaotic element, paired with Tweedy’s vocals, brought the performance together. A few hits they played were “Impossible Germany”, “I Am Trying To Break Your Heart”, and “ Jesus Etc”. Along with these hits, the band did special takes of old songs. “Via Chicago”, a slower, gentle, and emotional song, became very unpredictable and sporadic.This unpredictability, naturally led by Cline’s electric energy, aided by Glenn Kotche’s drums, redefined the gentle song into something more frenzied. Additionally, the band played a fan favorite, “California Stars,” but instead of California, they replaced it with “Carolina Stars”. The sentimental change for the Carolina atmosphere brought many to come together and sing along. These small changes made the songs feel completely different and connected to the audience. 

For anyone who isn’t familiar with Wilco (Or what my dad calls “Chicago Guitar Gods”), the band consists of Jeff Tweedy (Vocals), Nels Cline (lead guitar), Glenn Kotche (drums), John Stirratt (bass), Pat Sansone (keyboards), and Mikael Jorgensen (electronics). The band is from Chicago, originating back in 1994, and emerged from the breakup of the alt-country band Uncle Tupelo. The band has been significant since their creation, with their most popular release being “Yankee Foxtrot Hotel” (Fun fact: The album cover is the Marina City Towers in Chicago). The band has changed throughout the years, never holding themselves just to one genre. Wilco is typically associated with alt-country, folk, and experimental rock, but continues to create music and redefine what Wilco is. 

Wilco has encapsulated generations of music lovers and continues to do so with over a 30-year-long journey. It seems like the band has no signs of slowing down and will continue to create the masterpieces that they do. If you ever have the opportunity, make sure to give them a listen and even try to snag a ticket for their tour.
