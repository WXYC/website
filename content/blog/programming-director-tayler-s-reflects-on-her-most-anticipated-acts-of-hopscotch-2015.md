This year will be the third I attend Hopscotch Music Festival, which has always blown me away with its immense diversity of acts and venues. Each year I’ve been, the huge number of shows has left me feeling a bit overwhelmed as well as excited, as I realized early on that I was able to tailor very different evenings for myself solely through my decisions of who to see and where to go. With so much amazing music happening each year, it’s been easy for me to feel like I might miss out no matter what itinerary I’ve set for myself.

Last year, in the midst of feeling suddenly unsure of my predetermined schedule, I chose to see an incredibly hype DJ set by Lunice, an artist I was completely unfamiliar with, over the mellow, ambient soundscapes of a longtime favorite artist of mine, Tim Hecker. Though it was a risky move due to my lack of familiarity with the artist, and though I most likely would have found Hecker’s set highly enjoyable had I gone, Lunice’s set better matched my mood that night and left me super pumped about new music in general. Because I decided to catch his set on a whim, I walked away that night having seen one of my favorite acts of that year’s festival.

Based on this experience, I’ve decided to avoid planning a set itinerary this year. Instead, I hope to go with the flow of the festival and my energy level and to see a ton of music that’s new to me.

This is all with the exception of a handful of acts that I absolutely will have to see no matter what…..

These are, without a doubt, my four personal must-see acts of Hopscotch 2015:

Silent Lunch, 10:30pm at Slim’s on Thursday![](/uploads/0004897806_10.jpeg)

Silent Lunch is an all-female rock band based in Durham, NC, and one of my favorite local acts that I’ve seen in awhile. I saw them at last year’s Hopscotch, and they killed it then, so I’m excited to see how they’ve evolved after a year.

Jenny Hval, 12am at Kings on Thursday![](/uploads/jennyhvalpress3.webp)

I’ve been really into Hval’s music since I first heard her album Innocence is Kinky about two years ago. I missed her when she came through Chapel Hill last year, so I’m doubly excited to get to see her this time around. Her voice is so ethereal and bizarre; I’m unsure of how she can achieve that beautiful flute-like timbre. I can’t wait to see it happen in person.

Le1f, 12am at Kings on Thursday![](/uploads/le1f2_0.webp)

This will likely be one of the most hype sets I see this year, if not the most. Le1f is such a talented rapper and producer and his music has such great energy, which I’m sure will rock Kings to its core. This is another case of an artist I once had the chance to see but didn’t, so I’ll be happy to finally rectify my mistake of missing out the first time.

4\. Zs, 12am at the Hive on Saturday![](/uploads/maxresdefault.webp)

I think this show will probably be the noisiest I see, which will leave me with no complaints. The band members are incredibly talented musicians, and in their recorded material they play off each other so impressively. I’m anticipating that translating to a truly mind-bending live performance.
