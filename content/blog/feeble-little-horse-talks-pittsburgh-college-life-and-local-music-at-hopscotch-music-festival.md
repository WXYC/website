WXYC spoke with Pennsylvania-based indie rock band feeble little horse after their performance at Hopscotch Festival in Raleigh. The band – formed in 2021 – consists of Lydia Slocum, Sebastian Kinsler, Ryan Walchonski and Jake Kelley.

WXYC: First of all, I know all of you guys are \[or] were in college. We’re with WXYC Chapel Hill, UNC-Chapel Hill’s radio station. So we are, too, in college, and I was wondering – what’s it like being a student and then going back, or, I guess, playing shows, and then going back to being a student, and then going back to playing shows? Do you find yourself struggling to acclimate to that, or is it kind of natural?

Lydia: I was going to a private Christian college for like five semesters, and it was definitely weird to play shows and then go back to that, because I just felt like it was two totally separate lives. But now I go to Chatham \[University] in Pittsburgh, and I feel more like one person instead of two different people. But it was definitely, like, strange to acclimate to and and be around people that just seriously don’t care at all.

Sebastian: We just kind of said no to a lot of stuff. Like, you can’t do everything. You can play Saturdays. But it works, so don’t drop out.

Ryan: I’m not a student.

Jake: We’ve never been, like, a full time touring band or anything. So going back to work or school just feels like normal, and it makes the shows feel more special when we get to play them.

That makes total sense. Speaking of Pittsburgh, I was wondering, how do you think that the city of Pittsburgh has affected your writing? I feel like it’s common to be shaped by your environment, and I was just wondering if that ever influences your lyricism in any way.

Lydia: I grew up in Pittsburgh, and I don’t know if Pittsburgh had anything to do with it, but I always felt very empowered to be myself and be creative and not worry about what everyone thinks. And I think that there’s just a lot of sources or resources in Pittsburgh to learn about different creators.

Ryan: I think Pittsburgh is a city where people who are creative can work and live. And I think when we were first starting, it was inspiring to find local bands that we like, who are making cool music, and who had the opportunity to do so. And we wanted to do similar. 

Jake: The bands in Pittsburgh – that was the first time I’ve seen just people you know making music that other people like and think is cool. There’s a lot of different kinds of music in Pittsburgh, so there’s something for everybody. And I think that it’s part of the reason it makes it very special.

Lydia: I will just say, Pittsburgh is, like, almost too small, but there’s a really close knit community, and I feel very encouraged by the people that do know about our project. And I think that that validation right off the bat was really helpful in like, getting us out of our comfort zone and like playing shows really early on, even though we didn’t think – we didn’t know if we could ever even be a live band. So I think people encouraging us in the scene really made a huge impact. 

Yeah, it’s definitely a very small community in this area as well. I always find it interesting how there are so many different scenes, and they all kind of mimic each other in a way. I was wondering, do you guys have any favorite Pittsburgh artists, or just artists that are in your circle from the area as well? 

Jake: [Gaadge](https://gaadge.bandcamp.com/) makes shoegaze in Pittsburgh that’s catchy and good.

Lydia: I haven’t seen them live ever, but there’s this awesome screamo girl band called [Not Your Friends](https://notyourfriends.bandcamp.com/album/constructing-a-mental-breakdown?fbclid=IwY2xjawFRdKFleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHXmqsJkGGoM1lTQSreXCjJ3nUZB-WIF0Rt_HVz7VIzMfsLPAsHOLefXMww_aem_p0e3zzK02LpX0mwoBMf95w) that I need to connect with. But there’s like, so many bands.

Ryan: I like [Ex Pilots](https://expilots.bandcamp.com/) from Pittsburgh. They just released an album that I thought was really good.

Sebastian: I love [Sleeping Witch & Saturn](https://sleepingwitchandsaturn.bandcamp.com/). And [Water Trash](https://watertrashpa.bandcamp.com/) and [Tony from Bowling](https://tonyfrombowling.bandcamp.com/).

Have any of you guys been to North Carolina before?

Lydia: I have. I have family here. I grew up in South Carolina. I lived there from ages one to five. 

Oh, that’s so cool!

Lydia: I, like, didn’t grow up, but I remember it.

Yeah, exactly. That’s awesome. How are you guys liking it so far? 

Sebastian: I think it’s the most beautiful state in the entire country.

Are you just saying that?

Sebastian: I’m not just saying that! Everything’s so beautiful, everyone’s so nice. Food tastes better. I’m happy. 

Lydia: We’ve been here for two, three hours!

Sebastian: It’s my favorite. It’s my favorite. It’s the best state. 

Ryan: We’re right next to a hotel, and I think at the hotel there’s some kind of wedding convention? There’s a ton of women in wedding dresses and men in tuxedos. So, I think North Carolina just makes me feel like everyone’s getting married all the time. 

Jake: Yeah, North Carolina’s home to the greatest cough medicine of all time, called the Carolina Crud Crusher. It’s crazy. My mom bought it when she was visiting my grandparents. And every time … \[to bandmates] I’m not lying – do you want? You can try some when you get sick next time. The Carolina crud Crusher, it’s crazy, it works very well.

Thank you guys so much. I really appreciate it. Is there anything else you guys wanted to say?

Sebastian: Do you want us to do a radio tag?

Oh, yeah, why not! Absolutely! 

Lydia: Can we swear? 

No, no. 

Sebastian: What if we say, “We’re feeble little horse, and you’re listening to ‘bleeping’ WXYC?” 

All: Hey, we’re feeble little horse, and you’re listening to BLEEEEEEEP WXYC 89.3, Chapel Hill.
