Beirut-based composer and multi-instrumentalist Charif Megarbane released his second album under Habibi Funk Records this July and it does not disappoint! The album is made up of fourteen tracks loosely centered around the theme of the color red, and each captures a different aspect of the color and it's associations—from aquatic life to lively energy, emotions, and structures. 'Hamra / Red' seems to just build onto the sweet and funky sounds of Megarbane's previous Habibi Funk release, Marzipan, and it's catchy and cheerful melodies are perfect for the summer. Always excited to hear new stuff from Habibi Funk and its collaborators.

Jessica Pratt's fourth album is further proof that she's a master of the subtle, sweet, somber folk tune. Inspired by summer evenings, L.A. artists and (according to Pratt herself) the "dark side of the Californian dream," she skillfully merges 1960s folk, jazz, bossa, and lounge music together to create a hazy, nostalgic sound drenched in atmosphere. But her lovely alien voice and smooth, modern production push her music just a bit more into a realm completely detached from both time and place. It's the perfect summertime album for closing out the night, caught in a pool of emotion at the end of another long day.

St. Vincent’s newest album, All Born Screaming, is equal parts female rage and whimsy. Singer and guitarist Annie Clark produces a collection of full, layered, and mixed-genre songs that continue to surprise, from one track to the next and even within a single song. She is unapologetic in her vision, creating depth through the use of different levels and tones, building tension while providing a satisfying flow for the album. There were too many influences for me to list, but I spotted some 90s grunge rock elements as St. Vincent’s vocals vary from the likes of the Breeders to siren songs. You’ll have a new favorite track every time you listen.

Southern rap is having its renaissance, especially for Snow Hill, NC’s own Rapsody. While not a new name in the game (she was featured on Kendrick Lamar’s TPAB, and won acclaim for her 2019 release Eve), Rapsody locks into her own groove with this introspective album. She bucks at the label of being a “conscious rapper” by releasing a deeply self-conscious and vulnerable album. One of my favorite lyricists in the game, Rapsody delivers incisive bars over RnB, gospel, and reggae inspired productions.

![](</uploads/Astrid Sonne-Great Doubt.jpeg.webp>)Great Doubt- Astrid Sonne (Escho)

Danish composer and violist Astrid Sonne took over the WXYC airwaves with the release of her third album, Great Doubt. Although the album spans less than 30 minutes, Sonne is able to masterfully demonstrate her compositional and productive abilities to create a whirlwind combination of classical and electronic elements. The album’s highlights are in moments during “Do You Wanna”, where a booming and powerful drum pattern creates a sense of ominousness as she sings about desire and indecision. The star of the album is the nostalgic and free flowing “Staying here” that will undoubtedly be one of my favorite tracks of the year. Astrid Sonne’s songcraft is electric and inventive, and she has proven herself to be one to watch.

Katie Crutchfield’s Waxahatchee (also of Plains) is back with a gorgeous twangy indie rock album. Her vocals are gorgeous and unique as always, and now we also get MJ Lenderman on guitar and backup vocals! Truly a dream combo. "Right Back to It" is the standout of the album, but my other favorites include 3 Sisters, Lone Star Lake, and Bored.

Psychedelia is experiencing a golden age as queer and BIPOC artists continue to produce fantastical pieces of music that defy the conventional restrictions of the genre. La Luz, one of these artists, is a queer femme indie psychedelic ensemble combining the poetic lyricism of seasoned song writers with mystical instrumentals to create stunning sonic landscapes. The album addresses the intricacies of familial relationships and understanding of self as the album's songwriter, Shana Cleveland details her experiences with motherhood and breast cancer through language and a title inspired by Octavia Butler's work in metaphysical poetry. This stunning album is best listened to all the way through, but each song is able to stand on its own in a unique and memorable way.

Vampire Weekend- Only God Was Above Us (Columbia)

I have listened to Vampire Weekend since I was a little kid. I loved the first three records, and while I enjoyed 2019's Father of the Bride, I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed by the band's turn to writing increasingly obvious pop tracks and the unfocused nature of the album. Only God Was Above Us represents both a return to form for Vampire Weekend as well as a rebirth of sorts. The entire album is enveloped in an urban psychedelia, with stabs of noisy fuzz from buzzsaw guitars punctuating several tracks and providing texture unlike anything on previous releases by the band. Lead singer Ezra Koenig's lyrics ooze existentialism, detailing generational conflicts, fear of the future, and the act of letting go.

The record is contradictory by nature: melodies are both unique and strangely familiar, lyrics are self-referential yet transcendent, and production choices are crisp and modern while exuding nostalgia. There isn't a track that I don't like on Only God Was Above Us, though standout tracks for me are "Classical", "The Surfer", "Mary Boone", and the epic closer "Hope". This record is undoubtedly a high point in the band's career and is a rewarding listen for old and new fans alike. If you are in search of varied, rich (sound-wise and lyrically), and atmospheric indie rock, look no further.

L’Impératrice (“the empress”) is a pop and nu-disco group based in Paris, France who have been bringing forward an electric and funky sound since 2012. Their third studio album Pulsar builds onto the well-loved and refined grooves in their 2021 release Tako Tsubo. The new release includes collaborations with names such as Maggie Rogers and Erick the Architect. The best word to describe this album is FRESH! Beyond the iconic bass-heavy grooves that the group consistently delivers, Pulsar highlights the 2024 renaissance of hyper pop and electro-pop (especially in tracks “Amour Ex Machina” and “Sweet & Sublime”). Every track is somehow more delicious than the last.
