On a night in Richmond, Virginia, the band Bright Eyes took the stage at the National, showing the emotional rawness the band has been creating for many years. Connor Obsert, Bright Eye's frontman, made it clear that this was more than just a performance but a journey together, braving the night with sounds encompassing their entire discography. It was my first time seeing the band live, and it met my expectations—exceeding them even more. The atmosphere of the audience only added to the experience as every lyric was sung from the heart of many.

For anyone unfamiliar with Bright Eyes, the band is led by Connor Obsert, and the current band members are Nate Walcott (piano, trumpet) and Mike Mogis (guitar, banjo). They are accompanied by a rotating lineup of collaborators who mostly hail from Omaha's music scene. The band's origins started in Omaha, Nebraska, and have been around since 1995. Since their debut, "A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995-1997", the band has been able to release 10 studio albums with the most popular (and my favorite) being "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning". Their music consists of a manly Indie folk-rock sound, and they are now gaining a cult-like following. With Bright Eyes having performed several times at The National in Richmond, Virginia, the crowd still felt as excited as ever.

After the opener, Bright Eyes' began with a few songs from their new release, "Five Dice, All Threes." The night proceeded with songs from a variety of their releases. A few of the staples played include "First Day Of My Life," "We Are Nowhere, and It's Now," and "Poison Oak." It was an amazing experience to see some of my favorite songs and to find songs I hadn't ever heard. A song I found was "Take It Easy (Love Nothing)," which has since become a new band favorite for me.

Bright Eyes, throughout the night, connected us and shared their passion for music. To share the emotions of loss and grief but also of happiness and love. This variety of thoughts and emotions brought the audience together with the band, uniting as one. Not only was the music able to bring the audience together, but it also conveyed the message Bright Eyes has to share. Bright Eyes has recently begun the "Poison Oak Project," which aims to donate part of its proceeds to local LGBTQ+ communities.
