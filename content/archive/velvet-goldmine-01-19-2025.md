Join DJ Copperhead this Sunday (7-9pm) for a deep dive into the rise and fall of Ziggy and Iggy in Todd Haynes’ 1998 tribute to ‘70s glam-rock, VELVET GOLDMINE! Inspired by the lives and work of David Bowie, Marc Bolan, Iggy Pop, and Lou Reed, witness the blend of fact and fiction in glam-rock’s chaotic, vivid, and subversive scene with tracks from Brian Eno, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, T. Rex, and many more!!!
