For this week’s Sunset Soundtrack, join DJ spacetime to celebrate the specialness of TRUE STORIES, David Byrne’s oddball musical about a small town in Texas and its people and places. Tune in this Sunday from 7 to 9 p.m. for gabble about newspaper clippings, suburbanization, conspiracies, hippie-era Steve Jobs, and tones. There’s a little bit of everything in Texas ⭐️💾🚗🛣️🗞️
