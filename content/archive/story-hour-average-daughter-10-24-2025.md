Tune in TONIGHT for a very special specialty show!! From 9pm to 10, hear STINK read Elif Oguz’s Average Daughter’s Thoughts and Writings— a collection of short stories, poems, and even a muffin recipe.

Oguz’s work intimately explores themes of growing up, change, death, and class. They hope that this show inspires “non-writers” to try their hand at writing!
