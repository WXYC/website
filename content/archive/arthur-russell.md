An electronic music pioneer and a celebrated avant-pop composer, Arthur Russell is a profoundly influential figure in modern dance music. A native Iowan, classically trained in cello with a background in Indian classical music, he found his place in the underground NYC club scene in the 1970s and 80s. He jammed with Talking Heads, collaborated with Philip Glass, and was mentored by poet Allen Ginsburg.  

Upon his passing in 1992 at age 41, Russell left behind nearly 1,000 hours of recorded material spanning disco, country, and avant-garde orchestral pieces. Tonight from 9-midnight, we take a deep dive into a selection of his captivating works.
