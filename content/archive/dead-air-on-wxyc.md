Howdy kids! This week, the Thursday Night Feature from 9-midnight again delves deep into the archives of jam, bringing you live and direct the Grateful Dead. In this iteration of “Dead Air” host Massie Minor will bring you entire sets from the bands ’87 shows in Hartford, CT. Riding the popularity generated from their only top ten hit, Touch of Grey, these jammy grooves were introducing a whole new generation to the greatest show on the road. From Chuck Berry covers like Promised Land to ethereal grooves like Dark Star, these shows have it all! Of course, while the boys take their set breaks your hosts will explore other music of the period. Highlights will be some killer Dylan covers courtesy of Willie Nelson and Articolo 31, the Italian hip hop duo, as well as some of that cosmic American sound we love so well. So tune in, turn on, and let the good times role!
