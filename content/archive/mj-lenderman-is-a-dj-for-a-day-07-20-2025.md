DJ Lenderman is manning the airwaves! Tune in this Friday from 5-7 PM for a super special visit from North Carolina's own, MJ Lenderman! Jake will browse our station library, pick his favorite records, and co-host a full WXYC set with DJ Olive Oil ahead of his July 23rd performance at DPAC with The Wind.

If you missed the show, or wish to revisit it, the link to his set on our archive can be found [here.](https://archive.wxyc.org "MJ Lenderman DJ Set")
