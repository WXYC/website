In anticipation of Protomartyr's new album, ‘Formal Growth in the Desert’ (releasing at midnight!), this week's Thursday Night Feature w/ DJ POTUS will travel through the Detroit band's music from the past decade, seeing how they've developed into the post-punk powerhouse they are today. [@protomartyrband](https://www.instagram.com/protomartyrband/)
