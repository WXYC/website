This Thursday Night Feature showcases key Tipitina’s Record Club releases drawn from the last five years. The Tipitina’s Record Club has been quietly releasing some of the most lovingly curated archival New Orleans treasures anywhere taken from master tapes and pressed onto heavyweight vinyl—180 grams of Gulf Coast music. These include early releases, rare finds, live electricity, and essential reissues. Hear DJ Jazz Incognito play the 5-year catalog of the New Orleans sound including Professor Longhair’s piano thump, James Booker’s harmonic witchcraft, Mardi Gras Indian chants, electric funk, and everything in between.
