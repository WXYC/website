on this weekâ€™s thursday night feature, join the bandit on a journey into the world of heavy metal music. in a scene with a reputation for being unwelcoming, there are the artists who make space for themselves. we gather to celebrate the minorities within the metal scene, bands and artists who identify as bipoc, women, or queer. from the most metal of heads or newbie to the scene, this show is for you.
