This week we lost two music legends, Sly Stone and Brian Wilson, whose influences have made a mark on listeners and musicians across decades. WXYC's music library would surely not be the same without their inspirations. 

Listen in at 9pm for a three-hour specialty show as tribute to the lives and music of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson, featuring The Beach Boys and Sly & the Family Stone's greatest hits, as well as our DJs' favorite songs, facts, and anecdotes.
