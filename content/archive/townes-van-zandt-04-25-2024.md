Tune in this Thursday (4/25) 9pm-midnight to bask in the high lonesome sounds of the one and only Townes Van Zandt! Heralded as one of the greatest Texas songwriters of all time, Van Zandt's discography brims with some of the most gorgeous, melancholic songs of the 20th century. DJ Bedhead will be taking a 3-hour deep dive into the brilliant work and tragic life of this outlaw country legend. Spend this Thursday evening dreaming of the open road, only on WXYC!
