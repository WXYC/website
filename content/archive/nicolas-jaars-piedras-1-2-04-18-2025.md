Tune in to Inside Track this Friday April 18th (9-10pm) for a glimpse into the crashing blend of reverb, experimental pop, and ambience in Nicolas Jaar’s PIEDRAS 1 & 2. First conceptualized as a sonic tribute to the victims of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s authoritarian regime, Jaar explores the power of DIY Radio and liminal spaces when matters of place and home are threatened by colonial, oppressive forces. PIEDRAS 1 & 2 expands beyond Chilean history with its layered rhythm and haunting atmosphere, calling out Palestinian erasure and the threat of detainment and disappearance that activists, educators, and artists continue to face.
