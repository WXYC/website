Tune in to this Sunday’s Sunset Soundtrack, which highlights the media collection of Hirayama, a humble toilet cleaner from Tokyo in Wim Wender’s PERFECT DAYS (2023). From his cassettes of Lou Reed, Patti Smith, and The Velvet Underground, to the works of William Faulkner and Patricia Highsmith, join DJ Desire Path and DJ Copperhead in their exploration of physical media and the art of enjoying small, perfect moments.
