You've been formally invited to Join DJ Moonstruck and DJ POTUS this Sunday to celebrate the final episode of HBO's Succession!! They'll be spinning tracks from the original score composed by Nicholas Britell along with music used in the show's most memorable scenes. Your hosts will discuss their favorite scenes and characters, the babygirlism of Kendall Roy, and most importantly.... who's gonna be CEO?!? Tune in this Sunday from 7-9pm (immediately before the series finale airs!) and prepare to uh, yeah, go freaking nut-nut, okay man?
