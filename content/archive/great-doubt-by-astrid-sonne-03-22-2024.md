If you’re a fan of experimental, electronic-infused tunes, there’s no better way than to spend your Friday night tuned into WXYC, wafting through the soft, sparse lyrics and pulsing instrumentals of Astrid Sonne in her newest album, Great Doubt. 

Join DJ Gingersnap from 9-10 PM for a special Inside Track exploring the brilliant third full-length LP from Sonne by tuning into WXYC 89.3 FM or wxyc.org, or listen on the WXYC app!
