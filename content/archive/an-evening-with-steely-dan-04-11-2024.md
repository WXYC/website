Calling all major dudes ðŸ¥¨! 89.3â€“donâ€™t lose that number! Tune in this Thursday (4/11) from 9-midnight for three straight hours of THE DAN! DJ Geegland will be delving into the groupâ€™s smoky sounds, cynical philosophies, and constantly interchanging lineup of incredible studio musicians. Are they a musical group ðŸ¤¨? An artistic movement? Decide for yourself and chill out with some jazz rock goodness this Thursday :)
