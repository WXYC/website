This Sunday from 7-9pm 🎥 Tune in to WXYC as DJ Geegland discusses two of the contemplative, delicate film scores of multi-talented composer Emile Mosseri. In both “Minari” and “The Last Black Man in San Francisco,” Mosseri’s score backtracks beautiful narratives that explore themes of identity, the reality of the American dream, and the complicated nature of family (whether chosen or not). See you at the movies :)
