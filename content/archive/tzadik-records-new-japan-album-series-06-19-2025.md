Tonight on TNF: Join dj barely there from 9-12 for a deep dive into Tzadik Records' "New Japan" album series! Composer and saxophonist John Zorn's label Tzadik has been home to some of the most unique luminaries in avant-garde music since 1995 and released its full back-catalogue to streaming services in 2023.

The celebrated "New Japan" series aggregated genre-busting contributions from all across the world of Japanese experimental music, ranging from eerie avant-folk to glitch, jazz, and free improv. Tune in for songs from artists like Ikue Mori, Keiji Haino, Ground Zero and more!

Listen in June 19th from 9pm to midnight, only on 89.3 FM, wxyc.org, and our WXYC app!
