Join DJ dirteater this Friday to explore Sufjan Steven's latest folk masterpiece, Javelin! Be reminded to embrace those closest to you and appreciate every moment you have with them as you enjoy gentle acoustic fingerpicking and sweeping electronic crescendos. Maybe even weep a little as you listen to excerpts from the ten-part essay he wrote to accompany the album. All the Sufjan lore and more only from 9-10pm on wxyc!
