Feel it all this Thursday as DJ dirteater and DJ Alexa Chung deep dive into twee indie pop darling turned folk icon, Feist! From the 2007 iPod nano advert that ignited her fame to a surprise appearance on the latest season of The Bachelor, we'll be exploring the life and work of the Canadian artist, our favorite songs, collaborations, and live performances. "Sometimes we don't get to love who we are meant to," but you can listen to three hours of Feist this Thursday 9pm-12am only on WXYC!
