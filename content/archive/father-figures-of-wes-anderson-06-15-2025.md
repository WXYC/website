Tune into this Sunday's Sunset Soundtrack for a Father's Day special spotlighting the work of Wes Anderson, honorary father of contemporary auteurism, scripted blinks, and strange, colorful, dysfunctional families. 

Join DJ Copperhead for a deep dive into the soundtracks of *The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou *(2004) and *Fantastic Mr. Fox* (2009), featuring the original scores from Mark Mothersbaugh and Alexandre Desplat, as well as hit songs from David Bowie, Seu Jorge, The Zombies, Beach Boys, and more!
