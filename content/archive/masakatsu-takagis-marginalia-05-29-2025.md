Join DJ Spacetime for a deep dive into the recent works of Japanese composer Masakatsu Takagi. MARGINALIA is a series of beautiful solo piano improvisations complemented by chirps and rustles coming through an open window, a sonic sensation that suggests everything might be okay after all...at least for these three hours.
