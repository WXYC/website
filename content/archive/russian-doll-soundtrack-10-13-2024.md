This week's Sunset Soundtrack hosted by DJ Gingersnap takes a deep dive into Natasha Lyonne's Russian Doll, writing and starring in this comedy-drama series as a young woman who gets caught in a mysterious loop as she repeatedly attends the same party each night, dying and waking up again and again as if nothing had ever happened. Tune in to WXYC on 10/13 from 7-9 PM to travel through time and hear all of your favorite tunes from Harry Nilsson, Depeche Mode, Janis Joplin, The Velvet Underground, Pink Floyd, and other well-loved hits!
