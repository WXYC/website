Sad you’re missing ’We Out Here’, summer’s hottest festival across the pond? Come join DJ Gopher for a sonic spin down the Thames, as she takes you through the rule-bends and rhythmic twists of the London Nu-Jazz scene. With injections of afrobeats, funk, grime, house, soul, cumbia, brokebeat & more, this is jazz not as you (Americans) know it. 

Jazz lovers and haters alike, join the jam session online or on the airwaves, at 89.3 FM.
