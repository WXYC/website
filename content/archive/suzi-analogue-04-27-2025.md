This season of Backyard BBQ ends with a performance from the extraordinary Suzi Analogue.

As one of UNC's most beloved professors and the founder of UNC's Hip Hop Ensemble, Analogue has made a deep impact on students and had brought their global influence to focus here in Chapel Hill. Outside of the classroom, Analogue is a prolific producer, songwriter, composer and the creator of Never Normal Records. She energetically pioneers the new wave of women producers in electronic music and beyond.
