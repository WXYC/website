DJ Lenderman is manning the airwaves! Tune in this Friday from 5-7 PM for a super special visit from North Carolina's own, MJ Lenderman! Jake will browse our station library, pick his favorite records, and co-host a full WXYC set with DJ Olive Oil ahead of his July 23rd performance at DPAC with The Wind.

Tune in at 89.3FM, on the WXYC app, or at wxyc.org. Love live college radio!!
