Nope, the ProgDay Festival is not a bunch of Yes and ELP sound-alike bands like your father used to listen to, the ProgDay festival hosts the best in avant-progressive jazz/rock/metal...of all types from all over the world.Â Thursday night's TNF will be an overview of bands that will be appearing, and which have appeared at the ProgDay Festival. The ProgDay Preview show will start at 9pm EST on August 31 and run until midnight.

Student tickets are 50% off, and we will be giving away 2 pairs of tickets during the show, so tune in on 89.3 FM in Chapel Hill, NC or catch the stream at www.wxyc.org
