Have you grown quite weary? DJ Low Morale and GASTRIC DEMON are here to offer you a nice egg in this trying time. We’ll serve you pigeon, and we won’t make you do the dishes. We’ll offer you the boy’s soul, and we won’t make you pay the troll toll. Rob McElhenney once said, describing the sheer amount of words in the show, that “never has so little been by so much.” We plan to channel that paradigm of storytelling this Sunday, 7pm-9pm.
